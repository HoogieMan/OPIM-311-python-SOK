UNGC Principles: Human Rights

PRINCIPLE 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. PRINCIPLE 2 Businesses should make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

Barrick recognizes that the scope and breadth of human rights is far reaching. As stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services" and "everyone has the right to education." Barrick makes an active and positive contribution to human rights through programs that provide access to education, clean water and health services for the communities neighboring our mines. We are committed to promoting health & safety practices for our employees and adhering to security practices based on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR). Our Policies, Systems and Commitments that support this principle include: · Barrick's Corporate Social Responsibility Charter affirms our commitment to observe the fundamental tenets of human rights. This commitment is imbedded in our corporate culture and is aligned with the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Barrick's significant procurement agreements include human rights clauses, as we require our suppliers to adhere to our standards and policies as outlined in our Supplier Code of Ethics. Barrick is a member of the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM), and is committed to ICMM's Sustainable Development Principles, including Principle 2: Integrate sustainable development considerations within the corporate decision-making process; Principle 3: Uphold fundamental human rights and respect cultures, customs and values in dealings with employees and others who are affected by our activities; Principle 4: Implement risk management strategies based on valid data and sound science; Principle 5. Seek continual improvement of our health and safety performance; and Principle 9: Contribute to the social, economic and institutional development of the communities in which we operate. Barrick actively participates in the following ICMM committees: Community and Social Development Task Force; Artisanal Mining Working Group; Resource Endowment Initiative Working Group; Indigenous Peoples Working Group; Business and Human Rights Working Group; Safety and Health Task Force; Fatality Prevention Working Group; and the Health Working Group.

·

Barrick's Safety & Health System features nine core elements including Leadership & Commitment; Training and Competence; Risk Management; Operational Controls; Health and Wellness; Contractor Controls; Incident Investigation; Emergency Preparedness; and Performance Measurement and Assessment. The Courageous Safety Leadership training fosters a shared common vision on safety and health as well as the personal behaviors necessary to achieve that vision. The initial training is mandatory for all new employees at our operations and business offices around the world. At the end of the Courageous Safety Leadership training, employees sign their commitment to our vision "Every person going home safe and healthy every day". Our Safety & Health Policy has been revised and updated to include concepts espoused in our Courageous Leadership material. The Policy now speaks to "What We Believe" and "What We Promise" to do. Company-wide Drug & Alcohol Policy and Smoke-Free Policy were put in place in 2007. Company-wide policies on Mobile Equipment Operating and Hazardous Energy Isolation were implemented in 2008. Prior to 2005 our contractors' incident frequency rates were double our employee rates. Our Contractor Safety Policy was implemented in 2005. The Policy requires all contractors to have a comprehensive safety and health plan and specific personnel assigned to the safety and health functional area. The Policy also requires a Barrick representative with strict accountabilities for contractor performance. Contractor frequency rates have continued to improve and in most areas are on an even par with employee performance. Company-wide Working at Heights Policy, Use of Electronic Devices While Driving Policy, and Lightning Protection Policy were approved and implemented in 2009.

Barrick's Pascua-Lama project has achieved more than seven million hours (or five years) with no lost-time injuries. In 2009, we continued our emphasis on Courageous Safety Leadership training for employees, managers and contractors worldwide. This training has significantly contributed to improving our overall safety and health performance and creating a global culture with safety embedded as a personal value. In addition to further implementing elements of the Barrick Safety System, we participated in a number of safety forums to share lessons learned, best practices, results of incident investigations and benchmarking safety statistics with other companies. In 2008 we collaborated with ICMM in development of the best practices manual "Leadership Matters ­ the Elimination of Fatalities". Barrick continues to collect data on occupational health from our operations and has improved upon health risk assessments at each of the operating facilities. We continue to capture employee lost days due to ill health (nonoccupational health reasons) and are developing strategies to address these issues. In 2009, we began collecting statistics on occupational diseases and expect to develop an occupational frequency illness rate as data collection matures. In 2008, we published the first internal annual Health Report identifying the top causes of days lost to illness. Barrick continues to raise awareness for a healthy workplace, including further analysis of the data in the Barrick Health Report, a focus on fitness for work, industrial hygiene programs, and ergonomics in the workplace. Barrick has a comprehensive Health Risk Assessment Process to assess the risk of infectious disease at its operations. Once the Risk Assessment is completed, mitigation strategies are developed. At all relevant sites, we have established comprehensive HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria control programs. These programs have on-site and community components and involve the company, local government, NGOs and private sector partners in implementation. The Engender Health/CHAMPION program was launched in 2009 to address the problem of HIV/AIDS in the communities near Barrick's mines in Tanzania. The program will help reduce the vulnerability to HIV/AIDS by promoting national dialogue about gender roles and increased gender equitable beliefs and behaviors. A pilot program was launched at Bulyanhulu in 2009 will plans to expand into the North Mara and Buzwagi regions in 2010. A part of the Drive First program for employees, Barrick has developed a series of on-line training modules designed to help employees improve their driving behaviors; purchased four "light vehicle" simulators to help

4

drivers develop their skills, judgment and response and, in 2009, piloted in-vehicle monitoring devices that coach drivers on safe driving behaviors at two mines in Nevada. Global implementation of the in-vehicle monitoring devices will begin in 2010. In 2009, 20 Barrick sites were recognized for outstanding achievement in safety by the International Society of Mine Safety Professionals (ISMSP).

Security
Policies, systems and commitments
· · Our comprehensive Security Policy is based on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) and was implemented globally in 2008. As part of our security program, all security managers and security officers who carry firearms receive human rights training and all operations where firearms are used are governed by the requirements of the United Nations Guidelines for the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (as required by the VPSHR). In 2007, we convened a working group of Barrick staff and external experts to develop a strategic approach for the management of illegal and artisanal mining. This approach was validated by an independent expert on the issue of security and human rights and led to the creation of our Security Strategic Plan, which was reviewed and updated in 2008.

·

2009 Outcomes
Barrick's Security Strategic Plan was rolled-out in 2009. Training programs based on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) are now in place at all relevant operations and projects. In 2009, we continued to monitor compliance with the VPSHR via an external independent review process.

In 2010, we will continue to improve the management of illegal and artisanal mining issues through independent monitoring; stakeholder engagement and the roll-out of the Security Strategic Plan.

Community
Policies, systems and commitments
· Our Community Relations teams, as well as regional and site employees, are guided by our Community Engagement & Sustainable Development (CESD) Guidelines. The Guidelines outline the principles, standards and approaches applied by Barrick which cover our community programs from exploration through operations to closure. They are based on international best practice including the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and ICMM's Sustainable Development Framework. Barrick operations will be updating their Community Engagement & Sustainable Development plans on an annual basis. In 2008, Barrick launched its new Community Relations Strategy, featuring a monitoring system comprised of social and community-related metrics. The Strategy was developed in consultation with Regional Business Units, and will provide a more focused and systematic approach to social risk management and community relations. Barrick's Community Relations vision is "Working together with local communities for mutual longterm success. Barrick has established a quarterly Closure Committee which Community Relations staff regularly participate in to review social issues. In 2009, Barrick developed draft Social Closure Guidelines which will be finalized in 2010.

·

· ·

2009 Outcomes
Company-wide roll-out of Barrick's Community Relations Strategy was completed in 2009. As part of the 2009/2010 independent third-party assurance process conducted by Bureau Veritas, we expanded the scope of assurance to include interviews with a broad range of stakeholders who interact with Barrick at the corporate and site levels at Cowal, North Mara, Tulawaka, Cortez Hills, Pascua Lama and Veladero. Investors, SRI groups and NGOs were interviewed, and they commended Barrick for this expanded assurance process, seeing it as a positive step towards continuous improvement in how we manage our environmental and social risks.

Sites continued to develop Community Engagement & Sustainable Development (CESD) plans, and these will be updated annually to demonstrate company-wide adherence to the CESD Guidelines. All sites set for closure within three years have social closure planning efforts underway or have already developed social closure components to their most recent closure plans. In 2009, Barrick contributed US$24 million in community benefits around the world. These projects range from community initiatives, infrastructure, scholarships, donations and sponsorship, including: · In Tanzania, Barrick is leading a cooperative effort to address some of the most serious health challenges affecting the Lake Zone region, home to nine million people and many of the country's gold mining operations. The Lake Zone Health Initiative builds on Barrick's comprehensive HIV/AIDS and malaria control programs near our operations. As part of the Collaborative Agreement Barrick signed with four Western Shoshone tribes in 2008, 150 scholarships have been created for Shoshone students, with $320,000 awarded by the end of 2009. This Agreement ensures that Barrick and Western Shoshone natives are able to work together with open communication and dialogue. In 2009, $263,800 was invested towards infrastructure development directly benefiting Western Shoshone communities, including the Ely Shoshone Tribe Elders Center; a building to house wellness and daycare programs for the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe; renovation of the historic Duck Valley court facilities; a computer lab and internet access for the Yomba Shoshone Tribe; restoration of the Owyhee Tribal Courthouse; and the Duckwater Community Park Project, which employed tribal youth during summer 2009. Building restoration and construction projects will continue to provide employment opportunities for Western Shoshone as the projects are developed. In 2009, Barrick updated the Socioeconomic Benefits Agreement with the local Pic Mobert First Nation, at the Hemlo mine in Canada (originally signed in 2008). In 2009 at the Cowal mine in Australia, we conducted a review of the 2004 Native Title Agreement and Cultural Heritage Management Plan to ensure ongoing compliance with the Agreement's commitments and to develop strategies for the coming years. The two-day review process took place in 2009 and involved Barrick community relations staff and Wiradjuri representatives. The process was very successful in demonstrating ongoing compliance with the Agreement's commitments and intentions. Barrick is working with the Canadian Embassy and the Centre for the Development of Women to develop a project in the small town of Cotuí, near our Pueblo Viejo project, that will train more than 150 women in

leadership, accounting, and business skills. A micro-credit scheme has been developed by the company which is enabling women entrepreneurs to set up small-scale businesses, such as food and servicesrelated enterprises. · The Cowal mine in NSW Australia has provided eight students from the local communities with three year scholarships to attend university. The scholarships were awarded as part of the Barrick Endeavor Scholarship Program which has provided a total of 80 scholarships to the local community since the program began in 2006. Barrick also committed $15,000 over three years to support the Country Education Foundation which assists young people with meeting the costs of tertiary education. In rural Tanzania, Barrick has teamed up with Bridge2Aid, a non-governmental dental organization based in the United Kingdom [UK], to increase access to emergency dentistry by training local health workers to provide simple but vital procedures. The first program at Bulyanhulu in May 2009 was a great success. The program uses UK dentistry volunteers to deliver the training. Each clinical officer is responsible for between 10,000 and 15,000 people, so the Bulyanhulu program alone increased access to emergency dental care for about 70,000 people. The program was extended to the Buzwagi mine in early 2010. Barrick has partnered with the Catholic University of Trujillo and the Trujillo Metropolitan Archbishopric to provide full university scholarships to aspiring low-income students from the La Libertad region in Peru. Barrick will fund 24 scholarships for outstanding students from the province of Santiago de Chuco, La Libertad region, to attend the prestigious Catholic University of Trujillo (UCT). Barrick has invested $2.5 million (Canadian) to support the creation of the CAPE (Capital for Aboriginal Prosperity and Entrepreneurship) Fund, a private sector investment fund to support Aboriginal businesses and entrepreneurship in Canada. Barrick is among 21 leading Canadian companies, private individuals and U.S. foundation that are investing in the Fund. The community relations staff at the Reko Diq project in Pakistan organized vocational training in tailoring for tribal women in this isolated western part of Pakistan. The goal of the project is to provide these women with skills which would enable them to run their own businesses in the future. Two villages close to the project site, Siah Reg and Humai, were selected for the project and local women were chosen to participate. Following completion of the six week training course, the eight graduates, now trained in design, cutting, sewing and tailoring, received sewing machines to enable them to generate income, as well as to sew clothes for themselves and their families. The graduates then secured their first contract to prepare 90 uniforms for Humai school children. Training will continue, moving to other small villages and expanding to include training in basic financial management skills and guidance on

forming a business association. The community relations staff at Reko Diq anticipate that, in future, these women's associations would be able to supply uniforms for the entire workforce at Reko Diq.

UNGC Principles: Labour
PRINCIPLE 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. PRINCIPLE 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. PRINCIPLE 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. PRINCIPLE 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in

We are committed to treating all our employees with respect and dignity, providing equal opportunity and freedom from discrimination for all our employees and contractors, to uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and to support the effective abolition of child labor. Our Policies, Systems and Commitments that support this principle include: · Barrick's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility Charter both include explicit commitments to fair employment practices, non-discrimination and a workplace where employees are treated with dignity and respect. Our Powerful Leadership Program strengthens leadership skills of our superintendents and managers, developing skills for providing feedback and coaching, leading change, delegating, resolving conflict, managing performance problems, and motivating high performance teams. Training is ongoing throughout the company. We respect the rights of our employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. We have a number of facilities around the world with unions or bargaining associations. We have worked and continue to work closely with these groups over the years to develop and manage effective labor relations programs. The workforce in the mining industry is predominantly male, and many women see this as a barrier to gaining employment in the industry. At Barrick, our focus is to employ the best person for the job; to choose people on merit. Our challenge is to ensure that we are welcoming to women so that we can employ the best among a wide candidate base. We continue to introduce policies and flexible work practices to encourage higher participation rates of women in the workforce. The legal age at which young people may work varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Barrick will not knowingly employ a person who is under the legal age of employment, or where that employment would contravene the ILO definition of child labor. A diverse workforce encourages creativity and innovation. We draw our workforce from many countries around the world, including each country where we operate, with the result that our workforce is extremely diverse in terms of national and ethnic backgrounds. We are committed to the localization of our workforce. To this end, we first recruit the bulk of candidates for employment from the local and regional areas near our operations. The company is committed to fair employment practices and a workplace in which all individuals are treated with dignity

and respect. We do not tolerate or condone any type of discrimination prohibited by law. The company expects that all relationships among persons in the workplace will be professional and free of bias and harassment. We are committed to ensuring that both the letter and the spirit of the law is recognized and in effect with respect to promoting equal opportunity in the workplace and ensuring all persons (both employees and potential employees) are treated on their merit. · Barrick conducts business in many countries and provides wages and benefits relative to regional economics. We exceed average wages in the countries where we operate. Benefits provided are in line with cultural sensitivities and include a core group of health care benefits at all operations, as well as non-core regional benefits. We developed a Supplier Code of Ethics, which was implemented in 2008, and we screen our major suppliers according to this Code. The Code is designed to help suppliers understand the business and ethical standards they must follow in any business dealings with, or on behalf, of Barrick. In all business dealings with Barrick, suppliers shall comply with the principles of the UN Global Compact, all applicable local laws and each suppliers own code of ethics policy. Barrick is a member of the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM), and is committed to ICMM's Sustainable Development Principles, including Principle 3: Uphold fundamental human rights and respect cultures, customs and values in dealings with employees and others who are affected by our activities.

2009 Outcomes
Barrick sponsored 350 apprenticeships at 19 operations in 2009. In 2009, we provided 620,000 hours of environmental, health, safety and emergency response training and over 500,000 hours of technical, managerial and leadership education offered both on and offsite. This training ranges from university degree courses, technical short courses to one and two day computer skills courses. By the end of 2008, 60 percent of our significant suppliers had self-certified with our Supplier Code of Ethics. In 2009, the percentage remained the same although the amount we spent on procurements increased significantly. During 2009, many new, significant supplier self-certified with our Supplier Code of Ethics, increasing supplier participation by approximately 30 percent. In 2009, Barrick developed scorecards and a process for managing supplier performance. The key areas of supplier performance to be monitored and managed are Health and Safety Performance, Technical / Commercial Performance and Environmental Performance. Our goal was to have scorecard in place for the top 5 suppliers in each of our four regions in 2009. Currently pilot programs are in place in each region with the

intent to have a scorecard in place for the top 15 suppliers in each of our four regions in 2010. In 2009, the number of expatriates represented less than 4 percent of our employees throughout our global operations. Barrick's leadership development program is going through a continuous improvement review and our goal is to address our changing business climate and skill development needs to improve our overall talent review and succession planning process. Our plan is to pilot a baseline Barrick Leadership Fundamentals program in the fourth quarter of 2010. At our Pueblo Viejo project in the Dominican Republic a skills inventory of the local workforce began in 2007. A Talent Database was established at the Recruitment Office in the community in Cotuí, which is open to Pueblo Viejo's contractors and sub-contractors, and talent fairs were held in the local communities. By October 2009, approximately two years later, the database had 6,733 applicant entries, with 3,566 of those available for hire. By the end of 2009, approximately 800 individuals from the Talent Database had been hired by contractors or sub-contractors. To date, approximately 2,200 individuals have participated in training to localize the workforce. As of late 2009, it was estimated that 90 percent of the Pueblo Viejo project's workforce were Dominican nationals. There were no incidents of forced or compulsory labor at our operations in 2009. In 2009, approximately 30 percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Procedures and standards for negotiations with trade unions have been developed either regionally or at each operation which has a trade union. At all unionized operations we consult and negotiate over changes in the organization. At the end of 2009, 18 percent of our management and supervisory positions were held by women. This included one mine general manager, and, at our corporate office, 17 women in senior management positions. There were no incidents of child labor at our operations in 2009. Our most significant contribution to the effective abolition of child labour is our investment in education, such as our partnership with CARE International in Tanzania, the Atacama Commitment and the Intel/Cisneros Foundation Class 21 program in Chile, and our community infrastructure development projects that support community centers and recreational areas.

Principles: Environment

Environmental Policy Statement outlines its commitment to proven natural resource management practices for the protection, reclamation and enhancement of the environment. Our Policies, Systems and Commitments that support this principle include: · We take a precautionary approach throughout the life of a mine by first assessing potential impacts, then evaluating how to avoid, mitigate or control these impacts. Controls typically include putting into place multi-layers of environmental protection and robust environmental management systems that include advanced planning against possible future events. · · Barrick is a signatory to the International Cyanide Management Code. Barrick contributed to development of the Code which is aimed at improving the global management of cyanide. Barrick is committed to state-of-the-art controls on all point sources of mercury air pollution. We worked with the State of Nevada, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Nevada Mining Association to develop the Nevada Mercury Air Emissions Control Program. This program is among the most stringent in the world. Barrick represented the International Council of Mining and Metals at the 25th Session of the UNEP's Governing Council meeting where an agreement was reached to develop an international legally binding instrument on mercury. Barrick is working with U.S. EPA in developing a federal rule on mercury air pollution control. Our Environmental Management System Standard (EMSS) addresses 15 elements of environmental management, including environmental technology and life-cycle planning. Barrick established an Energy Group to assist our operations in implementing energy efficiency programs and alternative energy initiatives. We have energy champions at our operations who promote energy efficiency projects and programs. These include energy awareness education, the use of solar water heating and high efficiency lighting at some of our mine camps, compressor controls and fuel management programs. In 2009, Barrick approved and implemented five corporate-wide environmental standards: Water Conservation Standard, Biodiversity Standard, Mine Closure Standard, Environmental Standard, and Climate Change Standard. Barrick is a member of the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM), and is committed to ICMM's Sustainable Development Principles, including Principle 2: Integrate sustainable development considerations within the corporate decision-making process; Principle 4: Implement risk management strategies based on valid data and sound science; Principle 6: Seek continual improvement of our environmental performance; Principle 7: Contribute to conservation of biodiversity and integrated approaches to land use planning; and Principle 8: Facilitate and encourage responsible product design, use, re-use, recycling and disposal of our products. Barrick actively participates in the following ICMM committees: Environment & Biodiversity Task Force; Climate Change Working Group; Water & Mining Working Group; Integrated Mine Closure Working Group; Materials Stewardship Task

2009 Outcomes
The Barrick Water Conservation Standard was approved in 2009 and implemented at all sites; standardizing site water conservation programs for both our operating and closed properties; 100% of our sites that are located in arid or semiarid environments have been assessed against current and future water scarcity taking into account potential changes due to climate change, and water management plans/programs are in place at all these sites. Water management plans vary in complexity but all include strict limits to the amount of water that can be extracted from the environment, and have reporting requirements. In 2009, total water consumption decreased due to water conservation activities. In 2009, Barrick tied for third (in recognition in corporate water risk reporting) out of 100 companies benchmarked in a recent multi-industry study ranking water reporting practices of publicly-traded companies, and was singled out in the study for providing the most comprehensive water accounting of all 100 companies assessed. The study, entitled "Murky Waters? Corporate Reporting on Water Risk, A Benchmarking Study of 100 Companies", was conducted by Ceres, a Boston-based coalition of investors with $8 trillion under management. In addition, Barrick ranked second among the 13 mining companies surveyed. Ceres considered five key categories of disclosure: water accounting, risk assessment, direct operations, supply chain, and stakeholder engagement. In 2009, Barrick approved a new Climate Change Standard and continued developing elements of our Climate Change Program, including a system that will assist with management decision-making going forward and will promote consideration of alternatives to minimize Barrick's carbon footprint. In 2009, we began tracking business air travel by our corporate employees, and we are also working with our top suppliers to develop action plans to reduce our supply chain carbon footprint. Our Climate Change Program targets relate to energy efficiency: (1) Energy Efficiency: our target is an 8% improvement in energy efficiency from 2006 to 2012. (2) Renewable Energy: our target is to supply 6% of our energy from renewable sources by 2012 and 10% of our energy from renewable sources by 2017. We will review and update these targets every 5 years. In 2008 and 2009 we completed over 35 energy efficiency projects and 7 renewable energy project at our operations. These projects resulted in 324,900 tonnes CO2e reduced and 725,000GJ of energy saved. In 2009, we sourced 9.6% of our electrical power, both self-generated and purchased, from renewable sources. In 2009, our Hemlo mine in Canada reduced, by 75%, their use of fresh water from a nearby creek by installing a

pumping system which recycles dewatering water and storm water runoff back to the process system. They are now using less than four percent of the creek water allowed by their permit. Barrick is currently investigating the use of non-food crop biofuels with test projects in Tanzania. We have also erected a wind turbine at over 4000 meters above sea level to investigate the potential for high elevation wind power and have a solar farm in Nevada which generated 2,450 mwh of energy. Construction is underway at our $70 million wind farm in Punta Colarado, Chile, which will feature 18 wind turbines and supply 36 MWs of energy to Chile's power grid. Barrick continues to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project and will participate in the Water Disclosure Project for the 2009 reporting year. Barrick developed a Corporate Biodiversity Standard in 2009. Environmental Impact Assessments [EIA] are completed at all projects prior to the development/operations stage. The EIAs identify biodiversity issues and outline programs and procedures for addressing site-specific biodiversity issues. Biodiversity strategies and programs have been implemented at all sites where biodiversity has been identified as an important or material issue. For example, we have programs at the following operations: Goldstrike, Pierina, Plutonic, Bulyanhulu, Kalgoorlie [KCGM], Cowal, Veladero, Tulawaka and Lagunas Norte. Site-specific biodiversity programs are reviewed during company audits. There are academic, third-party and / or community stakeholder involvement in the biodiversity programs at the following sites: Goldstrike, Pierina, Plutonic, Cowal, Veladero and at some of our reclamation properties. In 2009, Barrick had $89 million in environmental protection expenditures, including environmental monitoring, mitigation of environmental contamination, equipment to reduce emissions and the disposal of hazardous waste. All South American operations are ISO 14001 certified and receive regular ISO audits. Barrick's remaining operations are working towards ISO certification by the end of 2011. Of Barrick's 23 operations where cyanide is used, 19 operations were certified under the International Cyanide Management Code by the end of 2009. This represents 92% of gold produced from mines. Of the remaining four sites, three will be certified in 2010. The fourth site, which is not currently process gold nor using cyanide, will proceed with certification once processing resumes. In 2009, Barrick recycled 10.5 million liters of used oil, 16,000 metric tons of scrap metal, 2,000 metric tons of used tires, 900 metric tons of paper and cardboard, 146 metric tons of used batteries and 85 metric tons of aluminum cans.

To date, the Lake Cowal Foundation, which is principally supported by Barrick, has contributed to projects worth A$8.7 million and has improved close to 14,000 hectares of land in the region. The organization does a range of conservation, sustainable farming, educational and research projects in conjunction with the local community and other environmental groups. The goal is to enhance the environment around Lake Cowal, a nationally significant wetland. Barrick has set a goal to achieve a 10 percent reduction in environmental incidents in 2010. In 2009, we produced a comprehensive online Responsibility Report in an effort to be more environmentally conscious. An Executive Summary of the online report that was printed on 100% post-consumer waste fiber and is a carbon neutral document. Starting with 2009 data, we now have an external assurance process to assure our Annual Responsibility Report. As part of this process, the assurance consultants [Bureau Veritas] reviewed our data, management process, including data management and calculations relating to our environmental data. Their Independent Assurance Statement states, "The information and data included in 2009 Barrick Corporate Responsibility Report are accurate, reliable and free from material mistakes or misstatements."

2009 Outcomes
As in past years, in 2009, all supervisory and administrative employees completed an annual certification regarding compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Anti-Fraud Policy, including with respect to the Company's policy on anti-bribery and anti-corruption. To complement Barrick's existing training programs on the Code and the annual certifications of the Code, Barrick developed an on-line training module for supervisory and administrative employees in 2008. This initiative was implemented for Corporate office employees in the fourth quarter of 2008 and implemented across the Company in 2009. Barrick developed an on-line training program on the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related anticorruption laws in 2008. All employees in positions of trust are required to participate in this program. In 2009, Barrick investigated implementing a Supplier Grievance programs as part of our Compliance Hotline and is planning to deploy the program in 2010. This will allow suppliers a confidential method to report concerns
