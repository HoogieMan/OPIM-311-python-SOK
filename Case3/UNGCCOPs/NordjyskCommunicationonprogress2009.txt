COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2009
EXECUTIVE STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE GLOBAL COMPACT
Nordjysk Elhandel A/S is a competent and responsible energy supplier that supports the growing awareness of an interest in the environment. The company's line of business is clearly reflected in principles 7, 8 and 9 of the Global Compact, while the remaining seven principles support our ethical business practices. Nordjysk Elhandel confirms that we continue to support the UN Global Compact. The ten principles of the Global Compact concerning social and environmental responsibility have been and will continue to be the framework for the company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, both in Denmark, where Nordjysk Elhandel is domiciled, and in other countries, where a proportion of the company's activities are carried out. Nordjysk Elhandel's CSR policy has been adopted by the company's Board of Directors and applies to the entire company. We published the first COP a year ago, and since then we have told our business partners about our work and the results we have obtained based on the Global Compact, with the aim of encouraging our business partners to consider the benefits of the Global Compact and hopefully to join it themselves. An example of the impact of the Global Compact in the company within the area of climate is our Code of Conduct, which specifies the company's requirements and principles that determine which climate projects we will participate in, and describes the process that ensures monitoring of project implementation. Our Code of Conduct seeks to ensure as far as possible that no CDM and JI projects compromise our CSR and climate policies, and our careful project development process ensures that projects bring about the reductions in emissions which will gain UN approval. Another example of a new activity directed towards our customers ­ both private individuals and businesses ­ is the introduction of our CO2 Calculator, which allows each customer to calculate their CO2 emissions. The CO2 Calculator is available on www. neas.dk. UN activities In the past year we have participated in a number of UNDP meetings, where the topics have been: · · · · New guidelines on COP, presented by Soren Mandrup Petersen ISO 26000 Global Compact for 2010, presented by Mads Øvlisen Internal and external CSR communications The "World's Best News" campaign.

CSR AND THE FUTURE
Nordjysk Elhandel's vision is to be Denmark's most competent supplier of energy. We are now the market leader in Denmark in trading in energy for a low carbon economy, and we thus directly help to integrate renewable energy into energy supply to an even greater extent than previously. Our aim is to influence the voluntary actions of our customers, energy suppliers and business partners, both in choosing the most environmentally friendly forms of energy and in offsetting carbon emissions with credits or allowances. It is the company's ambition to expand our activities and to use our expertise internationally. In the long run, this would mean that our CSR policy will develop not only in relation to Danish conditions, but also in relation to the international markets. Bo Lynge Rydahl, CEO

TAKING CARE OF ENERGY
Nordjysk Elhandel A/S is a major Scandinavian energy company. We trade electricity, gas and carbon emissions in the Scandinavian and European energy markets and offer a range of trading and management services to producers and consumers of energy as well as to our foreign trading counterparts. Nordjysk Elhandel's business model is based on expert insight into the energy and commodity markets and extensive knowledge of our customers' exposure in these markets. We act as our customers' eyes and ears in the markets, with a perspective centred on optimizing value by managing risks. Since its establishment in 1998, the company has experienced rapid growth and strong development across several business areas. Today Nordjysk Elhandel is a market leader in carbon emissions solutions, wind energy trading, and combined heat and power plant production. Nordjysk Elhandel supports the UN Global Compact and complies with a progressive CSR policy and Code of Conduct. For us, responsibility is an asset, and through our engagement in renewable energy and in the UN's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) we are a dedicated participant in the development of a low carbon economy.

CORPORATE SOCIAL INNOVATION
Based on CSR, CSI is something we practise successfully within Nordjysk Elhandel. Innovations through responsibility and foresight in relation to the increasing demands for a climateconsiderate economy have made Nordjysk Elhandel the current market leader in the fields of low carbon economy and market services for wind energy. We accumulate knowledge about responsibility through awareness of social movements and through communication with our stakeholders. This in turn helps us to identify future opportunities and challenges, prepare the company for changes, and exploit this knowledge for business development and innovation. The boundaries of responsibility are constantly changing, and constantly impacting on our business conditions and opportunities. The most important principle in Nordjysk Elhandel's CSR policy is therefore that integration of social responsibility as a fundamental premise in our business development is our biggest asset in itself.

ACTIVITIES IN THE CLIMATE COMMITTEE IN 2009
The Climate Committee at Nordjysk Elhandel consists of 6 groups, all of which are working to identify carbon emissions and find CO2 savings within the areas of: · · · · · · Company premises Transport Paper, and other products and services Renewable energy Climate Accounts Good climate habits

CLIMATE
Nordjysk Elhandel aims to be carbon neutral by reducing and offsetting the company's own carbon emissions. We aim to limit our energy consumption by improving our energy efficiency, implementing power-saving measures and using energy from renewable-energy sources. Nordjysk Elhandel focuses strongly on climate change issues. We aim to take a progressive approach to global climate challenges, an approach that combines responsibility with business development. We actively work to reduce the company's own impact on the environment and the climate, and we have built up a business area for other companies' voluntary climate activities.

At the company's Danish premises, we have completed the registration of the consumption of all electrical installations and have fitted "powering on and off" timers on coffee-making machines, etc. Nordjysk Elhandel buys certificates from Danish wind turbines that correspond to the quantity of power we consume. All copiers are set up to print in black and on both sides of the paper to save power and consumables. The Transport group is working to identify and select environmentally-friendly cars that could replace the current company cars. The group is also working on issues such as interoperability, commuting to and from work, and incentive models that will increase the proportion of employees who bicycle to and from work. Within the area of renewable energy, we are in the process of identifying opportunities for and the economics of installing solar cells at the company premises, or alternatively investing in our own wind turbine. The company has "hired" a virtual employee that continuously provides information about good climate habits and on various energy and environmental issues. Nordjysk Elhandel decided in 2008 to produce annual Climate Accounts in connection with the company's annual report. The Climate Accounts are calculated for the entire company on the basis of the consumption of energy and transport. The Climate Accounts present Nordjysk Elhandel's total carbon footprint, the relative distribution of carbon emissions within three scopes, and sources of emissions.

Skelagervej 1 · 9000 Aalborg · Danmark · www.neas.dk · info@neas.dk

COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2009
It is compulsory to report on the first two scopes, while the third is optional. The three scopes are formed by the following sources: Scope 1: Calculate all direct emissions of CO2 from all company cars Calculate all indirect emissions from purchased energy This scope consists of CO2 emissions from the consumption of district heating and electricity at the company's three Danish addresses: Skelagervej 1 (Business), Sofiehøj 6 (company apartment) and Østerbro 42 (former domicile). This scope consists of CO2 emissions from all business travel, commuting, employees ' private motoring, consumption of paper, IT equipment and furniture, catering, mailings and print production, accommodation and other services, etc.

Scope 2:

Scope3:

Calculate all indirect emissions other than from purchased energy

2009 CLIMATE ACCOUNTS
In 2009 Nordjysk Elhandel exceeded the 2008 CO2 reduction target of 10% per employee. We have achieved a reduction of 16.7% per employee, which is considered very satisfactory. The amount of CO2 emitted has been offset via UN carbon credits generated from Nordjysk Elhandel's CDM and JI projects.

CLIMATE ACCOUNTING METHOD
In 2009 Nordjysk Elhandel used a new method for calculating the company's carbon footprint which can quantify CO2 emissions on the basis of both monetary and physical values. The company's emissions are calculated for each euro spent on products or services, as well as on the basis of the company's physical consumption of energy and fuel, etc. This method has the advantage of making it possible to thoroughly map all three scopes. Nordjysk Elhandel's total CO2 emissions in 2009: Scope 1 - Direct emissions (Compulsory reporting)

232 tonnes CO2

Scope 2 - Indirect emissions from purchased energy (Compulsory reporting) 286 tonnes CO2 Scope 3 - Indirect emissions from sources other than purchased energy (Voluntary reporting) 2,783 tonnes CO2

CLIMATE KEY FIGURES
In order to ensure the comparability of the results from the previous year, we have converted the key figures in the 2008 Climate Accounts to the new accounting method. Shown below are the key figures of Nordjysk Elhandel's 2008 and 2009 climate accounts, distributed by scopes, sources and emissions per employee.

*An improved method has been used to calculate the number of employees, with the aim of compensating for all of the company's CO2 emis sions..

REDUCTION TARGET
Nordjysk Elhandel's total reduction target for the next five years is a reduction in CO2 emissions of 15% per employee. The quantity of CO2 emitted by Nordjysk Elhandel will be offset via climate credits. The CSR and Climate Change Committee are responsible for clarifying, developing and implementing Nordjysk Elhandel's Climate Change Action Plan. Each year, Nordjysk Elhandel will prepare carbon footprint analyses of our own carbon emissions, and an annual climate change strategy for reducing both our carbon emissions and our ¬consumption of energy. A Climate Change Strategy, with defined ¬objectives, will be laid down each year. Nordjysk Elhandel aims to be carbon neutral. Our primary priority is to reduce our carbon emissions by increasing our energy efficiency and by means of other internal changes, while our secondary priority is to offset the quantity of CO emitted via UN carbon credits or from other similar projects.

Each year Nordjysk Elhandel will report on the following climate issues: · Carbon footprint and carbon credit accounting · The progress and results of climate change related activities · Climate change policy and strategy · Climate change related activities · Together with the Board of Directors, the CSR and the Climate Change Committee are responsible for implementing and executing NE's CSR and climate change objectives.

CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN
The action plan for 2010 includes quarterly reporting for scope 1 and 2 and a focused effort to implement initiatives to reduce the direct and indirect emissions in scope 3, which in 2009 accounted for 84% of total emissions, or 2,783 tonnes of CO2. The largest contributions to CO2 emissions were made by the activities of communication, meetings, travel and canteen, IT services and equipment, services, product purchases, com-

muting and building maintenance. We will select and analyse CO2-emitting activities from within these fields and analyse and implement initiatives to reduce climate impacts. We will use the results from the 2009 Climate Accounts to revitalise the CSR and the Climate Change committee's work groups. We can maintain dynamism in the work by adjusting the work groups to match the issues on which we choose to focus. More specifically, we will encourage dialogue and cooperation with suppliers and partners regarding analysis of CO2 emissions from their products and services. We will also set up a database for emission factors. We will make our initiatives and results visible internally within the company as well as externally. We will continue to use the experience gained from our own climate efforts to develop concepts and products to inspire customers and other companies to participate in the move towards a low carbon
