Overview
Promoting global wellness and nutrition, helping to build a more sustainable environment, and honoring our role in society from the farm to the family
This report is the product of an ongoing conversation that began 140 years ago, when our company's founders first started canningqualityvegetablesandsoupsfromasmallwarehouseinCamden,NewJersey.Itisaconversationamongouremployees, customers, consumers, and everyone else connected with Campbell Soup Company and our family of brands, about the role of a food and beverage company in our society -- its impact, contributions, and obligations . Current trends in corporate social responsibility (CSR) generally focus on accountability, transparency, and engagement . For companies in the food and beverage sector, however, there are a number of additional dynamics . Some issues unique to our sector include sustainable agriculture, responsible sourcing, promotion of human health and sound nutrition, and responsiveness to consumers' ever-changing expectations of the foods they choose for themselves and their families . At Campbell, we strive to address each of these issues . We recognize and respect the fact that "CSR" and "sustainability" mean different things to different people . First, here is some context on how we view these terms . At the most basic level, CSR and sustainability at Campbell Soup Company mean advancing global wellness and nutrition, helping to build a more sustainable environment, and honoring our role in society from the farm to the family . More broadly, we consider CSR and sustainability as approaches to the conduct of business that build employee engagement, create positive social impacts, enable operational efficiency, reduce costs, foster innovation, strengthen our relationships with our customers and consumers, and ultimately create business advantage over the long term . We firmly believe that a company should be judged not just on its financial performance but on its commitment to CSR and sustainability . We are confident that our consumers, customers, employees, and investors feel the same . We also believe that the importance of this commitment will increase as the 21st century progresses . We invite you to join our conversation today, and look forward to your participation for many years to come .

A Letter from Our President and CEO
Welcome to Campbell's 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report. We are delighted to have this opportunity to share with you the state of our progress, and the evolution of our thinking, in a journey of critical importance.
Dear Campbell Stakeholders:
For Campbell, conducting business in a socially responsible manner is mission-critical . Through our Campbell Mission, we have committed ourselves to building "the world's most extraordinary food company by nourishing people's lives everywhere, every day ." We recognize that achieving this mission depends on our ability to win, with the utmost integrity, in three arenas: the workplace, the marketplace, and the community . Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a central role in each . We win in the workplace by valuing and engaging our employees . We win in the marketplace by meeting the needs of our consumers and customers better, faster, more completely, and more uniquely than anyone else . And we win in the community by building on our long tradition of responsible citizenship, particularly in the areas of community service and environmental sustainability . In all three arenas, a vibrant CSR program inspires greater support of our company agenda while guiding that agenda in a caring, thoughtful, and socially responsible way . We firmly believe that, as we build a better company, we can also build a better world . Therefore, as outlined in our corporate strategies, we seek to "advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility" in everything we do . In our first formal CSR report, published in 2008, we outlined four focus areas: · Ourrelationshipswithourcustomersandconsumers · Environmentalsustainability · Ourcommitmenttobuildinganextraordinaryworkplaceand · Contributingtoourcommunities We reaffirmed our intent to keep building on our long track record of social responsibility . We committed ourselves to expand our CSR reporting over time, by providing our stakeholders with increasing detail and transparency about our aspirations, goals, and achievements .

Since then, we have made significant progress: · WerecruitedaVicePresidentofCorporateSocialResponsibility,chargedwithworkingacrossthecompanytobuilda comprehensive CSR strategy . · Webuiltanenterprise-wideCSRLeadershipNetwork,comprisedofbusinessleadersandcontentexpertstoclarifyour priorities, define and drive key programs, identify appropriate metrics and targets, and develop effective integration and communication strategies . · Westrengthenedourbondswithourconsumersand,asaresult,launchednewproducts,suchasCampbell's Select Harvest, a line of soups designed by women for women . · WeintroducedNourishing Our Neighbors, an enhanced community service program that brings together all of Campbell's community activities, including the Campbell Soup Foundation and others, under one umbrella . · Weannouncedafive-year,$10millioncharitablecommitmenttoourhometownofCamden,NewJersey. · WerelaunchedCampbell'sLabels for Education to focus this school-support program specifically on art, academics, and athletics . · Weeliminatedmillionsofpoundsofpackaging,optimizedshippingroutes,andadvancedenergy-savingcapitalprojectsthat have reduced waste and greenhouse gas emissions while saving water, energy, and money . · Weachievedworld-classemployeeengagement,whilecontinuallyenhancingourcultureofdiversityandinclusion. Most importantly, we undertook a thoughtful effort to create a clear and focused vision for all of our CSR efforts . There are many global issues that affect our business and our society, including health and nutrition, education, resource stewardship, climate change, alleviation of poverty, equality of opportunity, human rights, and others . In such a complex world, no company can be all things to all people . If we wish to have a meaningful impact, we must focus on those issues most closely aligned with our unique combination of skills, knowledge, and capabilities . During the past year, I challenged Campbell's CSR Leadership Network to define long-term "destination" goals that will clarify our purpose, promote strategic alignment across our organization, and deliver measurable benefits . The result -- Campbell's Corporate Imperative CSR 2020 Agenda -- defines "success" for Campbell in corporate social responsibility and sustainability over the next decade . The agenda includes four destination goals: 1. Nourishing Our Consumers -- Continually advance the nutrition and wellness profile of our product portfolio . 2. Nourishing Our Neighbors -- Measurably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing hunger and childhood obesity by 50% . 3. Nourishing Our Employees -- Achieve 100% employee engagement in CSR and sustainability . 4. Nourishing Our Planet -- Cut the environmental footprint of our product portfolio in half, as measured by water use and CO2 emissions per product produced .

These goals are not isolated platforms . They are a framework for making better business decisions -- for advancing nutrition and wellness in all of the countries in which we do business, for engaging our employees, for supporting the health of our planet, and for strengthening the communities where we live and work . We will regularly review these goals and their many supporting strategies, programs and targets, and make adjustments as needed . In adopting Campbell's Corporate Imperative CSR 2020 Agenda, we are leveraging our company's heritage, mission, and core competencies to define our opportunities and our signature in our society . We are building on a solid foundation . Our product portfolio is well-positioned to provide affordable choices to consumers that support superior vegetable nutrition, healthy weight management, and sensible snacking . We are highly active in our hometown communities around the world . Our employee value proposition is resonating with our people and driving stronger employee engagement . And our expanding work in the area of environmental stewardship is contributing directly to our bottom line while supporting the expectations of our customers and consumers . Most importantly, we are harnessing the expertise, enthusiasm, and dedication of our people to reach beyond sales and profits and make our world a better place to live . I can tell you that our people have responded to our heightened focus on CSR with a passion that energizes me . I am proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them in this important venture . Together, we will deliver on our CSR destination goals and thereby take another step toward achieving our mission: building the world's most extraordinary food company . Thank you for reviewing Campbell's 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report .

Management Strategy and Analysis
Our Mission: Together we will build the world's most extraordinary food company by nourishing people's lives everywhere, every day.
Campbell's mission statement clearly expresses our company's purpose . It inspires us not only to produce high-quality wholesome products that are trusted the world over, but also to make a positive difference in the world we live in, for the stakeholders with whom we interact every day . Campbell's Success Model, core business strategies, and balanced scorecard expressly incorporate and reinforce our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability . Our Success Model defines the way that we pursue our mission: Winning in the Workplace -- Placing the right people in the right positions, and creating a high-performance culture with world-class levels of employee engagement . Winning in the Marketplace -- Delivering above-average total shareholder returns by meeting the needs of our consumers and customers better, faster, more completely and more uniquely than anyone else . Winning in the Community -- Building on Campbell's long tradition of responsible corporate citizenship, particularly in the areas of community service and environmental sustainability . Winning with Integrity -- Conducting our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and in accordance with the highest standards of honesty, fairness and ethical business conduct .

Defining CSR and Sustainability Strategy
Every year we conduct a formal strategic planning process in which we reassess and refine our core business strategies . Since 2008, advancing a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility has been expressly identified as one of Campbell's seven core business strategies .

Our strategic planning process begins with a broad situation assessment . As part of this first step, we examine the key internal and external drivers of our CSR and sustainability strategy, including key trends in the area of sustainability and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders with respect to responsible corporate citizenship . Our strategic plan for CSR and sustainability rests on four key pillars: environmental stewardship (Nourishing Our Planet); our interactions with customers and consumers (Nourishing Our Consumers); community service (Nourishing Our Neighbors); and building an extraordinary workplace (Nourishing Our Employees) . As part of our annual situation assessment, we review our performance in each of these areas, and external trends and drivers in the marketplace and among our stakeholders, through a multifaceted lens that is depicted graphically below . In conjunction with our materiality assessment, we analyze our strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to help us fine-tune our goals, strategies, and operational priorities in each of our four primary CSR platforms . In 2009, we set the groundwork for Campbell's first formal CSR strategy, identifying several characteristics that are important to long-term success . They included, for example, a shared perspective on CSR across the company, definition of core metrics and long-term performance goals, and the recognition that our business executives and employees require specific resources and tools to activate our strategy . We declared that our strategy should provide for active stakeholder engagement; that our practices, performance, and results should be transparent; and most important, that our efforts should be shaped by a focus that is unique to Campbell Soup Company and the impact we can have .

Materiality Analysis
At Campbell, we examine the key internal and external drivers of our CSR and sustainability strategy, including key trends and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders with respect to responsible corporate citizenship . Defining materiality is an important component of an effective CSR and sustainability strategy . As a global food and beverage company, it is critical that we monitor and manage the myriad of business and societal issues in an effective and transparent manner . There are many areas in which Campbell's long-term business success aligns with important marketplace and stakeholder priorities, including sustainable agriculture, responsible sourcing, promotion of human health and sound, yet affordable nutrition . We believe that carefully considering these areas of alignment can lead to a more informed CSR strategy and help drive both positive social impact and long-term business success .

CSR and Sustainability Governance
One of the most important characteristics of a successful CSR strategy is an effective governance structure, with the resources and authority to make efficient decisions, establish accountabilities, and drive execution . We have created a CSR Leadership Network at Campbell that consists of five leadership teams . Each team has a formal charter, mission statement, and agreed indicators of success . Four of the teams are focused on our key content areas, including environmental sustainability, community service, building an extraordinary workplace, and delivering on the promises of our brands to our customers and consumers . These teams meet regularly to define strategy and review performance . The fifth team is our CSR Steering Committee, led by the CEO, which is composed of senior executives of the company's largest businesses and corporate functions, including Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, Legal, Research & Development, Public Affairs, and Information Technology . The Steering Committee regularly reviews progress updates from the four strategy teams . Periodic updates on the company's CSR and sustainability strategy are also provided to the Board of Directors .

Managing Performance
CSR and sustainability metrics are integrated in categories across Campbell's balanced scorecard. They range from specific steps in strategy development to individual reporting milestones.
Campbell employs a "balanced scorecard" to define annual objectives and measure the performance of the company as a whole and the individual business units . Goals defined in the scorecard fall within four key measurement areas relating respectively to the company's financial, strategic, operational, and marketplace objectives . Through our balanced scorecard, we assess not only whether we achieve our objectives, but also how we achieve them .

Corporate Governance and Ethics
Campbell is committed to winning in the marketplace and in the workplace in compliance with the law and the highest ethical standards. Our company has a long history of excellence in corporate governance.
Campbell's expectation of ethical behavior by every employee is rooted in our respect for the reputation of our great company and our convictions about the way we must conduct our business on a daily basis . Our multifaceted Winning With Integrity program provides the systems and tools to help our employees win in the right way, honor Campbell's distinguished heritage, and secure its future . All Campbell associates share the responsibility to make certain that our pledge to win with integrity in the marketplace, the workplace, and the community is fulfilled every day, in every decision they make and every action they take . Campbell's longstanding commitment to excellence in corporate governance is reflected in our Corporate Governance Standards, which are re-evaluated annually, and in the Board's painstaking governance process . Our Board has long been led by an independent, nonexecutive chairman . Systematic procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board and Board committees have been in place for many years .

Corporate Governance -- Board of Directors
Campbell's commitment to responsible corporate citizenship and the sustainable, long-term growth of our business begins with our Board of Directors . The Board consists of 14 independent members, one former company executive, and one current company executive, President and CEO Doug Conant . Board operations, including approval of agendas and information provided to directors, are managed by an independent, nonexecutive chairman . Our Board believes that diversity in the backgrounds and perspectives of our directors contributes to sound corporate governance . Three of our current directors are women . One director is from India, one was born and raised in Argentina, one is African-American, and one, who was raised in Colombia, is Hispanic . Our Board includes members with diverse business experience in the food industry, consumer products, financial services, retail, packaging, finance, and international business . Every member of our Board is expected to be a person of the highest integrity and to abide by exemplary standards of business and professional conduct . Our company has a long history of excellence in corporate governance . Campbell's Corporate Governance Standards, first published in our proxy statement in 1992, are reviewed annually by the Governance Committee and approved by the Board . The Governance Standards currently provide for four standing committees of the Board: Audit, Compensation and Organization, Finance and Corporate Development, and Governance . The Board focuses on the areas that are important to shareowners, such as strategy, risk management, leadership development, emerging markets, director recruitment, external development, and executive compensation . Directors meet individually with senior management and visit a plant facility each year to assess operations . In 2006, the Board approved, and the company implemented, a continuing education program that provides eight hours of instruction for directors on topics relevant to the company and to directors' fiduciary responsibilities . During a portion of every Board meeting, directors confer in an executive session in which no members of management are present . This past year, the full Board received an in-depth presentation on CSR and sustainability from our Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility .

Four years ago, the Audit Committee recommended, and the Board approved, a framework pursuant to which the Board as a whole and each of the standing committees have been assigned specific accountabilities for review of the Company's management of certain categories of enterprise risk . The responsibilities reflected in the framework are included in the annual schedules of recurring agenda items for the Board and the respective committees, and the Audit Committee reviews the framework annually . Review of the principal enterprise risks and the process by which those risks are managed and monitored, is overseen by the Board and incorporated into their annual strategic planning process . All of our directors stand for election each year . For their service, they receive annual fees based on the median director compensation paid by peer food and consumer products companies . Approximately 50% of each director's compensation is paid in cash and 50% is paid in common stock . Director stock ownership requirements have existed at Campbell since 1993 . Currently, our directors beneficially own more than 44% of our company's common stock . In FY2009, the full Board convened seven times, and all directors attended more than 82% percent of scheduled Board meetings and the sessions of the committees on which they served .

Public Policy Engagement
Campbell participates actively in the discussion of local, state, national, and international public policy issues relevant to our business strategies and operations, from food safety and advertising to healthcare and international trade . We also contribute to public dialogue on policy issues through our memberships in food industry trade associations, such as the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the Food Marketing Institute, the American Bakers Association, the Confederation of Food and Drink Industries of the EU, the Food and Consumer Products Association of Canada, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, and the International Life Science Institute . We express our views candidly and are committed to transparency in our interactions with government agencies and officials . Campbell's lobbying disclosure reports are filed with the appropriate state and federal authorities under the U .S . Lobby Disclosure Act and are available for review at www .senate .gov/legislative/ Public_Disclosure/ LDA_reports .htm . In 2009, Campbell adopted a formal set of Political Accountability Guidelines and related disclosures, which are available on the company's public website . In the U .S ., the company does not endorse any individual political party or candidate, but we do encourage voluntary political activity by our employees . Our employees can contribute funds to political candidates and organizations engaged in policy issues that are important to our company, such as food manufacturing standards and worker safety, through Campbell's Political Action Committee (PAC), a segregated fund that is affiliated with the company . Contributions made by the Campbell PAC are publicly reported in accordance with federal law . To view Campbell PAC's disclosures of contributions and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), visit www .fec .gov/finance/ disclosure/disclosure_data_search .shtml . Also in 2009, Campbell established its Public Policy Council, an 11-member committee of senior executives that evaluates and advises the company on the array of public policy issues that affect Campbell and the food industry . By providing thoughtful analysis and leadership, the Public Policy Council helps Campbell's Government Affairs group provide information and valuable insights to both to our trade associations and directly to regulatory agencies and elected officials .

Winning With Integrity
Codes and Policies
Campbell is committed to win in the marketplace and in the workplace in compliance with the law and in accordance with the highest ethical standards . We will compete vigorously, but we will be honest, lawful, and fair in our dealings with our employees, customers, consumers, communities, and all others whose lives we touch . This bedrock principle drives all that we do and illuminates all that we aspire to achieve . Our employees know that they are expected to honor our company's commitment to integrity at all times, everywhere in the world . Campbell's Winning With Integrity program provides the resources, tools, and guidance that enable our employees to understand and comply with our standards and expectations for business conduct . The program includes, among other things, an interactive website, extensive written materials, and a comprehensive, worldwide training program . Among the resources available on our website are Campbell's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our Corporate Compliance Manual, information about our Integrity Hotline and our compliance and ethics training program, and links to core corporate policies . Principal Codes and Policies Campbell's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is the foundation document of the Winning With Integrity program . The Code outlines our company's basic standards and expectations, highlights important Campbell policies, and summarizes certain fundamental legal requirements that our employees must follow at work . It also provides guidance about other resources to which employees can turn if they have questions or concerns about a potential legal or ethical problem . The Code is available in multiple languages, and every Campbell employee receives a personal copy . Individual corporate policy statements on specific compliance issues are issued by the CEO and updated as necessary . Other policies, manuals, and guidelines are issued by the respective business units and corporate functions . A central Index of Standards and Procedures for Compliance, maintained by the Legal Department, provides a comprehensive inventory of the policies, procedures, and guidelines in use at the corporate level and within the individual businesses and functions . New or revised corporate policies and guidelines are issued every year . In FY2009, for example, Campbell endorsed the United Nations Global Compact, adopted a formal set of corporate Human Rights Principles, and approved new guidelines on corporate political accountability and environmental sustainability . We also issued a new anti-bribery policy and guidelines for personal postings on social media by Campbell employees . Examples of key corporate policy statements and guidelines relevant to CSR and sustainability include the following: · Human Rights Principles · Environmental Sustainability Policy · Political Accountability Guidelines · Global Guidelines for Responsible Advertising to Children · Commitment Concerning Advertising to Children · Code of Business Conduct and Ethics · Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual

Education and Training
Campbell provides comprehensive training for every employee on "core" issues relating to ethics and compliance, and "risk-based" training that is tailored to individuals' roles in the company and the issues associated with their specific job responsibilities . As part of the Winning With Integrity program, all employees are required to complete annual training focused on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This training is available online or in person, and is offered in 13 languages . To maintain interest and engagement, we vary our core training courses by emphasizing different aspects of the Code every year . One course, for example, focuses on situations involving workplace harassment, discrimination, violence, and concerns about product quality . Another illustrates the application of the Code to issues relating to workplace privacy, confidentiality, conflicts of interests and gifts, financial integrity, and records retention . Our newest core training course, launched in FY2009, provides examples illustrating conflicts of interest that may arise from outside employment, the importance of reporting unethical behavior, and proper revenue recognition . Campbell's Integrity Hotline Campbell's Integrity Hotline is a service through which complaints and concerns can be reported to the Company or the Board on a confidential and/or anonymous basis . Access to the hotline is available through a secure Internet website and toll-free by telephone from all countries in which Campbell does business . To comply with special requirements of the European Union and in certain EU member states, we maintain a separate hotline service for employees in France, Belgium, and Germany . The availability of the Integrity Hotline and instructions for its use are widely publicized to our employees around the world . All reports to our hotlines are investigated . Evolution of the Program Our Winning With Integrity program is continuously assessed and adjusted to reflect developments in our business, such as entry into new markets and other strategic initiatives . Reflecting our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, new online training in diversity and inclusion was introduced in FY2009 . With the growth of our new business operations in Russia and China, we also expanded training on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . We also modify our training program, as well as our standards and procedures for compliance, in response to new legislative and regulatory requirements, enforcement trends, political and public policy concerns, and trends in the broader business and financial environments . Following the downturn in the U .S . economy, for example, we have intensified training on the management of credit risks . In FY2009 we also provided additional training for Human Resources personnel in the U .S . on recent developments in labor and employment laws and regulations, and special instruction to our sales personnel in Canada on the new Canadian Competition Law .

Stakeholder Engagement
Campbell applies multiple strategies to engage our stakeholders and gather diverse external perspectives on our business activities.

Consumers genuinely appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on CSR . Below are just three of the more than 100 comments we received after our most recent consumer survey of key CSR attributes and perceptions .

In addition, Campbell has established a Scientific Advisory Panel to provide external expertise on vegetable nutrition . The panel has been designed to provide strategic insights on current and emerging science on vegetable and plant ingredients including their nutrient/phytonutrient composition; the health benefits that these vegetable/plant ingredients and phytonutrients could provide; how manufacturing and processing may affect these nutrients and phytonutrients; and how product attributes can be delivered from this science . All of this information is part of the materiality assessment that is conducted annually in the CSR and sustainability strategic planning process .

Beyond soup, Pepperidge Farm has increased the number of 100 calorie packs that are being offered for both cookies and Goldfish crackers . Vegetable consumption as part of a healthy diet may also help with weight management . Recent research found that the simple addition of V8 100% vegetable juice in people's diets was part of a successful strategy to help them meet the vegetable guidelines .

Innovating with Ideas from Within Campbell and Beyond
Campbell has a passion for innovation . We continually seek to improve the quality, wellness profile, convenience, and value of our products . We are always interested in ideas for new products, packaging, marketing, and production technologies that will help us meet the needs of our consumers and customers better, faster, and more completely than the competition . We recognize that valuable ideas for innovation may come to us from many sources, both inside and outside the company . Consumers, customers, suppliers, contractors, inventors, and friends often have ideas that they would like to share with us, and we welcome them . To streamline this process, Campbell, introduced Ideas for Innovation in 2008 . This web portal enables people to submit ideas that are then shared with our skilled Research and Development and Marketing personnel, who are dedicated to improving our products, packaging, marketing programs and production methods . We also work with outside sources to develop innovative ideas .

In 2009 we also created ideaNET, an internal idea-generation program, and asked our employees to share their innovative ideas in areas like product development, sustainability, marketing, community programming, and health and wellness . Ideas that are submitted are acknowledged and reviewed by experts within the company . Campbell employees offered up more than 700 ideas in the first six months of the program . Beyond simply listening to feedback, we are actively engaged in programs designed to help our consumers live better and longer lives . We understand, for example, that it can be a challenge to manage dietary needs for individuals who are allergic to certain foods . To increase awareness and provide additional education for families affected by food allergies, Campbell has partnered with the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) to offer free six-month trial memberships to any family dealing with allergies . By helping consumers participate in FAAN, we seek to assist those with allergies to understand their dietary options and obtain the information they need to minimize health risks . For our consumers who desire products that are free from ingredients containing gluten we have created a website that can be found at www .campbellswithoutgluten . The site contains important information as well as a list of products in which every ingredient has been verified to be gluten-free .

Tracking Consumer feedback
Campbell conducts frequent surveys and other research to gauge consumer satisfaction and improve our understanding of what our consumers expect from us . We constantly challenge ourselves to find new and innovative ways to meet or exceed these expectations . According to The Center For Client Retention, Campbell ranked second and third in 2009 among 15 benchmarked companies in the United States in exceeding customer expectations for handling inquiries and complaints, respectively . Campbell also ranked first among peer U .S . food companies in overall satisfaction with our representatives with regard to handling consumer inquiries .

Providing Information Our Consumers Want
Campbell continually develops and tests new programs to provide consumers with useful information on meal ideas, health and wellness, and other tips . For example, each day our Meal-Mail program delivers nearly 500,000 recipes electronically to busy Americans who are hungry for convenient, great-tasting meal ideas that will please their families . Consumers can also access our Campbell's Kitchen website (www .campbellskitchen .com) at any time and download recipe ideas that have been tested and approved by our Campbell's Kitchen team, often with the assistance of our nutritionists .

New Product Innovation
We continuously strive to develop new products that will meet or exceed our consumers' expectations for taste, nutrition, convenience, value, and variety . All new products must meet our stringent standards for quality and safety . Our manufacturing processes are designed to ensure the retention of nutritional value and preserve the goodness of our wholesome ingredients . Campbell's Research and Development department is constantly monitoring trends and working to apply cutting-edge science to help the company grow globally . Our strategies are focused on providing better everyday simple meals, healthy beverages, and snacking choices . Our goal is to help consumers reduce negative components in their diets, close nutrition gaps, maintain healthy weight, and improve heart health, with a special emphasis on vegetable and plant nutrition .

Protecting Our Consumers
We maintain strict and consistent controls throughout our manufacturing processes, but we are also prepared to act swiftly and effectively if there is a problem with any of our products . If we suspect that the safety of a Campbell product has been compromised, Campbell's Corporate Crisis Management Team initiates a recall process to remove the product from store warehouses and shelves and alert consumers immediately . Working through protocols established by government agencies around the world, we provide regular updates to our customers and consumers on the scope and status of any product recall . We also have 24-hour support available to our retail trade customers and consumers to address any questions and concerns . In each FY2008 and FY2009 Campbell conducted three product recalls, impacting seven products globally .

Food Safety and Quality
Campbell has an extremely successful history of protecting the consumer. We fulfill the expectations that our consumers place on us to have robust safety and quality systems in place.
Campbell is committed to providing products that are wholesome, safe, and affordable . We are committed to maintaining our consumers' trust by continuously improving our quality control processes . We have devised a set of worldwide quality standards that define the requirements for food safety and quality . All Campbell businesses, as well as all of our suppliers and co-packers, are required to meet these standards . Our quality standards extend from the fields where our ingredients are sourced to the finished products that are shipped to our customers and then purchased by our consumers .

Ingredient Sourcing and Traceability
A quality product begins with quality ingredients . We purchase most of our fresh ingredients from farms in the countries where we produce products . We also source certain ingredients from carefully selected suppliers around the world . Our ingredient suppliers and contract manufacturers must meet the requirements for safety and quality set forth in our Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual. These requirements were developed after reviewing the quality audits of supplier manufacturing sites, and are based on careful study of best practices throughout the food industry . We conduct periodic audits and on-site inspections of our ingredient suppliers to ensure compliance with our worldwide quality requirements . To further ensure that the ingredients we receive are safe, our suppliers must verify that they can trace their ingredients to their point of origin .

Product Manufacturing
Campbell operates more than 35 manufacturing plants in 11 countries with the support of more than 2,000 individual suppliers and more than 70 co-packers . Our facilities produce more than 5 billion packages of 10,000 distinct soup, sauce, baked snack, bakery, and beverage products . Throughout the manufacturing process, our quality teams monitor, identify, and address potential issues that could create a quality or safety risk . In collaboration with our suppliers, other food manufacturers, and customers, Campbell has committed to the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), establishing manufacturing facility food safety systems certification to GFSI recognized standards as a requirement . · foreign Material: We use a variety of advanced technologies, including X-ray, metal detectors and magnets, process audits, and inspections to protect against foreign material contamination . We share best practices and technologies with our suppliers and co-packers to prevent contamination early in the food chain . · Allergens: We maintain strict internal controls to safeguard against cross-contamination of allergens during production . We control for a variety of food allergens, including fin fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy protein (dairy in Australia), soy protein, wheat, and sesame seeds . Campbell has invested in data systems to maintain label ingredient statement and claims accuracy, such as gluten-free products . We have also pioneered the use of advanced coding and scanning technologies that enable individual package verification of labeling accuracy, allergen control, and product traceability . · Genetically Modified (GM) Ingredients: We limit our use of GM ingredients primarily to ingredients derived from soybeans, canola, and corn sourced in North America . We adhere to all local labeling requirements in the markets where our products are sold . The company respects local market regulations and preferences regarding the use of GM ingredients .

food Safety
Campbell has a great legacy of leading the industry in food safety . Food safety involves the growing, handling, preparation, and storage of food with the goal of preventing food-borne illnesses . At Campbell, food safety involves a collection of departments and teams that partner to manage risks and protect our consumers, our customers, our brands, and our Company . Campbell professionals bring together a variety of scientific disciplines, such as toxicology, microbiology, thermal processing, analytical chemistry, and forensic analysis . Campbell experts are heavily involved with, and are often leaders in, the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) and other highly respected technical, trade, and scientific organizations with committees dedicated to food safety and analytical chemistry . Campbell has an extremely successful history of protecting the consumer . Campbell employs several layers of technology to keep our food products safe from optical sorters to magnetic scanning to eliminate any metallic objects . To make certain that what's on the label is what's in the package, Campbell helped develop a "vision" system to ensure that the proper labels are placed on every can or package . Another emerging area is cutting-edge X-ray technology that not only can detect metal, glass, and other dense foreign objects, but can also identify package or filling defects . We also understand that our products -- and our reputation -- are only as good as the ingredients that come from our suppliers . Campbell has developed a comprehensive "farm to fork" program designed to protect the safety of ingredients and products throughout the supply chain, involving suppliers, packagers, and co-manufacturers . Our suppliers' quality controls must be as good as ours, and we validate their processes to ensure that they are . Vendors must meet stringent requirements using procedures called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a systematic, preventive approach to controlling and eliminating all types of food safety issues . We use HACCP in our own manufacturing facilities as well . Vendors and co-manufacturers also are subject to rigorous and regular audits by Campbell's Global Procurement and Supply Base Quality teams to ensure continued compliance with our exacting standards . We verify the safety of the ingredients and finished products using analytical tests, microbiological assays, and investigations of packaging integrity -- a holistic approach that makes Campbell a leader in food safety .

Advancing Social Impact with Our Consumers and Our Customers
Campbell's strategic partnerships increase our ability to impact issues that are important to our consumers, customers, and society.
As part of our mission to nourish people's lives everywhere, every day, Campbell has developed several signature strategic partnerships that allow us to make a more powerful impact than we could on our own in areas as diverse as urban farming, promoting sustainable agriculture, accessible and healthy nutrition, addressing hunger in the U .S ., bringing positive opportunities to our youth, and even promoting awareness among women of the impact and causes of heart disease .

Sustainable Agriculture
National FFA Organization and Urban Farming At Campbell, our dedication to making the best soups goes beyond the ingredients . That's why we support local farms and farmers across the United States . For the past two years we've teamed up with the National FFA Organization to plant seeds in community gardens, provide agricultural education grants to benefit young farmers in training, and help revive, preserve, and restore American barns . As part of Campbell's Help Grow Your Soupprogram,wehavecontributed$500,000totheNationalFFAOrganizationtosupport scholarships for tomorrow's leaders in sustainable agriculture . Campbell also worked with the National FFA Organization and Urban Farming Inc . to create five community gardens in urban communities across the U .S . After being planted, the gardens were maintained by members of FFA and Urban Farming, and all the vegetables harvested were donated to the local community .

Hunger Relief
Helping Stamp Out HungerTM The need for food assistance has never been greater . According to the U .S . Department of Agriculture's annual study measuring food security in the United States, the number of Americans living in food-insecure homes increased from 36 .2 million in 2007 to 49 .1 million in 2008 . Even more troubling is the fact that one in four is a child . Stamp Out HungerTM is the National Association of Letter Carriers' national food drive held on the second Saturday of May each year . Campbell promotes the drive in the media and with the help of retail partners in-store . The company underwrites the cost of the postcard that is sent to every home in America to promote what is the world's largest one-day food drive . In 2009, a record 73 .4 million pounds of food was collected by more than 230,000 letter carriers . Campbell and the National football League Tackle Hunger Through the Campbell's Chunky online Click For Cans program, we try to engage consumers in order to increase awareness regarding hunger in America . The Chunky brand team provides a donation of 32,000 cans of Campbell's Chunky soup to the Feeding America food bank partners of individual NFL teams . In addition, as the Click For Cans competition progresses, the food bank of the winning team is awarded an additional donation of 17,000 cans of Chunky soup .

vegetable Nutrition
feeding America and V8 Make Every Serving Count Campbell's V8 brand teamed up with Feeding America's National Produce Program to help provide more than 30 million servings of fresh vegetables and fruit to those in need . The national Make Every Serving Count campaign's objective is to make it easier for Americans living at risk of hunger to obtain nutrient-rich fresh produce in their diet . Campbell and V8 embarked on aconsumereducationcampaignandmadea$1milliondonation,allowingFeedingAmericatoprovidemorethan30million servings of fresh produce .

Nutrition and Wellness
Healthy Weight Commitment foundation Campbell is a founding member of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation . The Foundation works to reduce obesity, especially childhood obesity, by 2015 by promoting the importance of energy balance -- balancing calories eaten with calories burned through activity -- and focusing in three critical areas: the marketplace, the workplace, and schools . As part of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, Campbell is committed to building on our portfolio of healthy products in the marketplace, especially those well-suited to supporting healthy weight . We will continue our work with leading wellness organizations to help educate people about the importance of a healthy lifestyle . We are building on our nationally recognized and award-winning employee wellness programs to support our employees and their families and continuing to strengthen our commitment to America's schools with programs such as our long-standing Labels for Education program . Campbell Supports Go Red for WomenTM To Help fight Heart Disease It's no coincidence that the red color of our iconic soup label stands for love and passion, but also for strength and courage, which come to mind when you see the red-dress symbol . In 2008, Campbell partnered with designer Lisa Perry to re-imagine the Campbell red dress once again . Her winning design was worn by singer Toni Braxton on the ABC television show The View to kick off American Heart Month . Campbell continues its Red Dress commitment by partnering with The Heart Truth campaign . This year we asked people from all over America to submit their own designs and heart-health hero stories . Visitors voted on their favorite dress from the top three submitted . The winning dress and designer was showcased at the Woman's Day Red Dress Awards .

Through the partnership, the GRAMMY Foundation's proprietary Discovery Through MusicTM curriculum was made available to nearly 60,000 schools nationwide that are registered in Campbell's Labels for Education program .

LAURA LEE BLAKE Nourishing employees is as important as nourishing customers. At Campbell Canada, Human Resources Director Laura Lee-Blake is proud that Project Gateway, developed with heavy employee input has now launched, offering an expanded line of Gluten-Free and Halal-Certified products. "Throughout the project, our own employees who were also true consumers with these needs were used as sounding boards as we moved through the commercialization process," said Lee-Blake, who has been at the company for eight years. "It helps create a truly inclusive environment." Campbell Canada has 35 products that are certified Gluten-Free, including soups, salsas, sauces and beverages. The 13 HalalCertified products are all from the soup line. To ensure that Campbell Canada employees knew about the new products, the company undertook a number of initiatives including a one-day "Information Fair" featuring taste tests, guest speakers, and background presentations on Celiac Disease and Islamic practices. "This was an excellent example of how to ensure that we put as many resources towards educating our internal consumers as our external consumers," Lee-Blake said. In 2010, Lee-Blake hopes to find more ways to share wellness information with employees to "help them make better lifestyle choices in order to stay healthy, happy, and productive," she said. She has some very specific goals, like a wellness program for the Toronto plant that focuses on stretching, and more general ones, like communicating the company's changes to employees so they continue to be proud to be Campbell ambassadors. She also wants to link programs and initiatives as often as possible so that wellness and diversity efforts become a foundational filter for everything the company does rather than being "programs" provided for employees. "It is just how we do business,' she says.

Overview
At Campbell, we are proud of our long-standing commitment to the communities where we live and work. That commitment begins in our hometown of Camden, New Jersey, and extends to many communities where our employees live and work. We describe our community efforts as Nourishing Our Neighbors. We are focused on areas where we believe we are uniquely qualified to make measurable social and human impact, based on our mission, geographic locations, and core competencies.
We apply three delivery lenses to create sustained CSR value in our community efforts: 1. Local Needs, Local Solutions. We know that one size does not fit all . We are also cognizant that we do not have people, plants, or even products in every community in the world . We do have long-term investments in many communities, ranging from wellness to nutrition to helping kids achieve their true potential in life . 2. Strategic Partnerships. We know first-hand that there are many great community-based organizations that know how to make an impact in the most efficient way possible . They know the local needs and how to maximize limited resources to make the most impact . In Camden alone, we maintain relationships with more than 100 community-based organizations that are aligned with our priorities and the community's most pressing needs . We maintain similar strategic relationships with other organizations in each of the communities where we live and operate to make the most significant positive impact possible . 3. Signature Programs. Some of our programs are specifically designed to make a positive impact on youth, to significantly address the U .S . hunger challenge, and to promote awareness among women of the impacts and causes of heart disease . Campbell's Labels for Educationprogramhasbeeninplaceformorethan30years,contributingmorethan$110million worth of equipment to schools . The Stamp Out HungerTM initiative is the nation's largest single-day food drive, which has collected almost a billion pounds of food since its inception, and AdDRESS Your Heart is a well-known partnership with the AmericanHeartAssociationinwhichCampbellhascontributed$3.6millionoversixyearstohelpfightheartdiseaseamong women . These are just a few examples of programs in which strategic collaborations allow us to make even more meaningful impact than we could on our own .

We have established new 2020 Destination Goals within our Nourishing Our Neighbors CSR platform . These goals will inform and prioritize our efforts and programs over the next decade . · Measurably improve the health of young people in our hometown communities by reducing hunger and childhood obesity by 50%.

Laying the Groundwork for future Impact
Campbell has a long history of making positive social impact in our local communities through monetary support, in-kind giving, and employee volunteerism . While this work has always been an integral part of our corporate culture, additional tools were needed to bring the program to the next level . The company's Nourishing Our Neighbors CSR pillar was redesigned in April 2009 to streamline our community programs across all U .S . Campbell locations . The platform encompasses all community initiatives, including the Campbell Soup Foundation, our Dollars for Doers volunteer matching grant program, matching gifts to education, in-kind giving, and the United Way employee giving program . Integral to the redesign was the Nourishing Our Neighbors portal, an online info-center for employees that allows them to search for volunteer opportunities in their area, log volunteer hours, apply for Dollars for Doers grants, and learn more about Campbell community programs . FromitslaunchinApril2009throughthefiscalyear-endinJuly,nearly1,000employeesaccessedtheNourishing Our Neighbors portal -- logging volunteer hours, searching for and managing projects, submitting requests for Dollars for Doers grants, and much more . The portal provided not only a one-stop shop of information on community programs, but also access to all U .S . Campbell locations, including home access for plant employees, making our programs more accessible to everyone .

Supporting Volunteerism
Beyond monetary and in-kind support, Campbell provides enthusiastic, passionate volunteers to local nonprofit organizations working to make positive change for residents in their communities. Whether volunteering on their own or as part of a departmental team, Campbell volunteers have done everything from skills-based volunteering, such as redesigning the layout for a Feeding America food bank to simply lending an hour to read to a child on-site at a Campbell location.
Employees volunteer in several ways at Campbell: · Allemployeeservicedays · Team-buildingactivities · Asindividuals At Campbell and Pepperidge Farm locations in the U .S ., employees engage annually in Make a Difference Week . In FY2009, more than 600 employees from seven different locations volunteered during the course of one week at 40 different projects, ranging from painting a mural at a local neighborhood center to planting trees along city streets . Volunteers worked with 20 nonprofits during the week, many of which receive funding throughout the year from the Campbell Soup Foundation . National Make a Difference Day, which Campbell participated in for the past 20 years, grew to Make a Difference Week in 2007, when it was recognized that Campbell employees were looking for more turnkey opportunities to volunteer during the work day . At Pepperidge Farm Headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, 200 employees worked with the Norwalk Parks and Recreation department to ready the Norwalk beaches for the Memorial Day opening during their annual employee service day . This effort was aligned with Pepperidge Farm's involvement in the development of Keep Norwalk Beautiful, an affiliate of Keep America Beautiful, in 2009 . The organization aims to beautify the city by adding more gardens and parks while keeping it free from litter and graffiti . Besides providing employee manpower, Pepperidge Farm donated trees and shrubs to the Norwalk Land Trust to help preserve a 16-acre park for birds and animals .

Dollars for Doers
Campbell employees are both encouraged and recognized for volunteer service completed during the workday and outside work hours through our Dollars for Doers program . Campbell employees are encouraged to volunteer during the workday at company-sponsored volunteer activities . These activities provide an opportunity for employees to work with their department or team on making a difference in their local community and building employee engagement . Team-building volunteer projects are scheduled by the Office of Community Service and local employee engagement teams at Campbell plant locations and managed through the Nourishing Our Neighbors portal . In the first four months of operation, opportunities to volunteer at more than 100 different nonprofit organizations were posted to the site, resulting in more than 700 employees across the U .S . logging more than 8,000 volunteer hours . At those rates, we expect to see several thousand employees use the tool every year, generating more than 30,000 hours of community service . Using the values put forth by the Independent Sector, a leadership forum for charities, foundations, and corporate giving programs committed to advancing the common good, Campbell employees volunteered approximately $162,000worthoftimeoverafour-monthperiod.

J I M H uf f MA N d e s c r i b e s N ou r i sh i n g O ur N ei ghbor s at t he i ndi v i dual l ev el For almost a decade, Jim Huffman has driven more than 20 extra miles a day to deliver meals to the elderly and homebound in his rural Northwest Ohio community. He shovels their driveways in winter, takes out their garbage, and performs minor home repairs, even if he has to climb up on the roof to do so. He'll stop by and keep them company, providing companionship as well as nourishment. "Everybody's struggling," Huffman said. "I have the time. Anything that I can do to help an elderly person stay in their house as long as they can, I will do." Huffman has worked for Campbell for 22 years. His current job is in the boiler house at the Napoleon, Ohio, facility. For him, it's not a big deal to work at Campbell from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., then start delivering meals at 11 a.m. It takes him at least two hours between driving and socializing, but he makes the rounds no matter how tired he is. "After I step into that first house, I've got a smile on my face," Huffman said. "I don't know who enjoys it more, them or me." Huffman delivers every day in the winter because he says, he works every day, so why not go the extra step? He said he's always been surrounded by generous people and he learned from them. As a child, he hung out at the local dentist's office, watching as the man gave away dentures for free. Campbell, Huffman said, "gives so much to this community, it's unbelievable." Besides corporate-wide programs like food drives, the local plant has also given money to build a local hospital wing and supported local charities. Huffman's fellow Campbell employees have also helped, swapping or filling in on shifts so he could make his deliveries. And the next generation of givers is coming: Huffman said his 19-year-old son was recently en route to the movie theater when he encountered a couple who needed help paying for gas. Huffman's boy gave the couple his last $8, and then walked home, forgoing his own entertainment. "He's something," Huffman said proudly. Like son, like father.

Campbell employees volunteer at their local Feeding America food banks in the U .S . and with Food Banks Canada . Volunteer service for local food banks goes beyond just hosting local food drives to much more involved skills-based volunteer initiatives such as assisting with the redesign of a food bank's floor plan, building shelving, sorting and distributing food, as well as serving on the board of directors . Employees also support other Campbell initiatives such as Stamp Out HungerTM, the nation's largest single-day food drive, with volunteer service . For Stamp Out HungerTM, employees sort food at local post offices and food banksthedayofthefooddriveandformonthsafterwards.FororganizationssuchastheFoodBankofSouthJersey,StampOut HungerTM donations represent one quarter of the food bank's total annual inventory .

Employee volunteers are constantly seeking to make a lasting positive impact on young people, especially in the area of education . In Camden, local students are brought to our headquarters for one-on-one reading and literacy instruction for one hour each week through the Reading STARS and Read and Believe programs . In FY2009, 80 employees increased the reading competency of elementary school students by an average of one grade level in just 16 weeks during Reading STARS . At Pepperidge Farm headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, employees are actively engaged with Kids in Crisis, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free counseling, shelter, and other services to troubled children and families in Fairfield County . Employees take the children on all-expense-paid shopping trips during the holidays to buy gifts for their families, engage in recreational games and activities with the youth, and much more . Employees at the Pepperidge Farm plant in Downer's Grove, Illinois, run an annual back-to-school backpack drive for local students .

Before the 2009­2010 academic year, Campbell partnered with the GRAMMY Foundation to provide schools that are registered in the Labels for Education program with access to the GRAMMY Foundation's Discovery Through Music curriculum . Customized for children in kindergarten through 6th grade, the six-week curriculum encourages life-long creativity, allowing children to explore and discover music within other subject areas like math and science . The curriculum gives students a foundation in basic elements, such as beat, tempo, rhythm, and pitch . It also provides ways for instructors to apply these fundamentals as part of lesson plans for any subject . Our partnership makes this curriculum accessible to nearly 60,000 schools nationwide .

Engagement & Recognition
We believe that our employees feel most valued when they are fully informed, understand the company's business goals and plans, and are invited to offer their feedback on a regular basis.
Research shows that engaged employees are more productive and profitable as well as more customer-focused, safer, and more likely to stay with the company . At Campbell, we firmly believe that employee engagement is one of the most important indicators of our ability to drive performance improvement and win in the workplace . In fact, every employee who participates in our Performance Management process must include a specific objective around engagement . In addition to improved business results, CEO Doug Conant attributes Campbell's culture revitalization over the past eight years to our continually improving employee engagement . Doug says, "We're performing at a higher level and are more innovative and more self-governed because our employees believe that each individual can make a difference to Campbell's success." Campbell began measuring employee engagement formally through the Gallup survey in 2001, and is proud of the considerable progress we have made each year . Based on these results, Campbell was recognized by Gallup in 2009 as one of the "Best Places to Work" in America for a third year in a row .

Over the past eight years, Campbell has continued to increase employee engagement to world-class levels as measured by our engagement percentile and engagement ratio versus the Gallup overall database, as well as the engagement ratio that compares the number of engaged employees to actively disengaged employees. In FY2007, our engagement percentile of 76% earned us Gallup's world-class distinction and in FY2008 our engagement ratio rose to world-class levels of 12:1. For FY2009, we maintained world-class levels across both measures.

While we are proud of our high engagement levels, we recognize that our work is not done, and there are many opportunities for improvement . We are focusing on three key areas for employees: to help ensure that they know what is expected of them, to have the materials and equipment to do their jobs, and to have the opportunity to do their best every day . Through team and department action planning, we are working to address issues that are critical to sustaining our high overall engagement . As part of the process, Campbell University provides a variety of tools and resources to help teams "go beyond the numbers" and create meaningful action plans around key factors that drive engagement .

Engagement in Action
Below are just a few examples of how the Campbell workforce around the world continues to be engaged:

EMPLOyEES POWERING INNOvATION
Campbell employees have long been engaged in efforts to develop new products that deliver against consumer needs and to identify ways to improve how we work. In 2009, ideaNET, a new online community, was launched. Here, Campbell employees in the U.S. and Canada can post ideas for improving Campbell's business and workplace and share their thoughts on ideas posted by others. ideaNET combines individual entrepreneurship with social networking. When an employee submits an idea, it is posted to an open "Idea Board" where other employees can share their comments and help build upon the concept.

AuTHENTIC ADvERTISING
To promote Campbell's Creations, a line of soups featuring the flavors and textures of homemade soups, Campbell Canada launched a commercial filmed like a home movie -- complete with an unsteady camera. The 30-second spot features Alison Hastings, Product Developer adding ingredients to a pot of soup in the Campbell's Test Kitchen and Hilton Cummings, Linesman, filling Team A explaining in the voice-over that Alison is making this Campbell soup more like homemade, with less salt and more herbs and spices. The employee-actors were selected through a "Souper Star Search" at the Toronto plant, where applicants were asked to explain why they are proud of their role in making Campbell's soups and proud to serve the soups to their families.

CAMPBELL TODAy
Campbell's daily, online publication provides high-quality news that is candid, interesting and timely. Recent features have included an update from the CEO on Campbell's business performance, a story on highly engaged teams, a summary of our new products in Canada, a report on a fundraiser for the March of Dimes, and an article highlighting the culture and traditions of the many American Indian employees at our Maxton, North Carolina, plant. The publication reaches 7,600 employees, and a recent online survey suggests that 90% read it regularly.

Employees from Pepperidge Farm headquarters, the company's Bloomfield, Connecticut, bakery, Arnott's in Australia, and Campbell WHQ submitted over 200 product and packaging concepts and presented them at Pepperidge Farm's Norwalk event. At the fair, attendees could see and taste the results of ideas before voting for their favorites. Design Manager Brian Klecatsky was one of more than 250 fair attendees. "It was energizing to feel the excitement and the pride people had in their ideas," he said. "I think that spirit and energy is part of what defines our unique culture."

Measuring Our Success
We believe an important indicator of program success is the level of employee satisfaction with the programs, in addition to improvements in behavior, health outcomes, clinical performance indicators, and medical decision-making . We have seen impressive outcomes for many of our U .S . health and wellness programs: · 1,685employeeshaveusedMDSTMservicessinceFY2006.88%ofsurveyrespondentsindicatethisservicehelpedthem become more involved in their care, while 76% said it improved their communications with doctors . · 48%ofeligibleemployeesreceivedflushotsinFY2009. · 1,932employeescompletedtheonlinehealthassessmentinFY2009. · 1,255employeesparticipatedinour2009HealthStationTour,with95%ofon-sitescreeningparticipantsindicatingthatthey felt more motivated to take health improvement action . · Aetna'sMedQueryTMprogramprovidedwellnessandqualityofcareinformationtoover6,500participants,resultingina healthcareplansavingsofapproximately$10peremployeepermonth. · 69%ofparticipantsenrolledinourLifestyleManagementprogramhaveimprovedoreliminatedmoderatehealthrisks. · BetweenNovember2005andNovember2009,1,302peopleenrolledinourtobacco-cessationprogram,withaquitrateof 44 .4% .

J AN KE L LY t a l k s a b ou t We l l n e s s a t C am pbel l Campbell strives to help employees become and stay healthy through its award-winning wellness program. We believe that a healthy workforce doesn't just mean that employees are free from illness, but that they're engaged in their work and moving toward a better state of being and vitality. One unique Campbell-provided resource is the Medical Decision Support (MDSTM) program. Upon diagnosis of certain conditions, employees and their family members can speak with a doctor from a leading medical school and/ or a medical researcher about their condition. As a follow-up, they receive a personalized information packet, as well as unlimited access to these live resources. The program was recently expanded to cover additional health conditions (e.g., obesity, autism) and to include additional resources (e.g., quality of care evaluation tools, research desk for any medical condition). Surveys show that 100% of Campbell employees who used these services would recommend them to others. "Helping employees improve their health is good for them, and good for Campbell as well," said Jan Kelly, Director of U.S. Health and Welfare Programs. "Studies show that companies can achieve a $1 to $2 return on every dollar spent on a comprehensive employee wellness program. Not only can this investment help Campbell control costs as healthcare prices increase, but it can provide immeasurable benefits as employees move toward a better state of health."

PANDEMIC PLANNING
Campbell formed a global Flu Response Team in light of growing concerns regarding H1N1 . The team includes representatives from Human Resources, Occupational Health, Security, Legal, Public Affairs, Risk Management, Information Technology, Supply Chain, and Research and Development . As part of the team's overall strategy, a global network of "Flu Coordinators" was established and trained, and a dedicated site for employees was created for the latest company guidelines on the flu, along with other helpful tools and links, including a self-monitoring screening tool .

Workplace Wellness in Action
We believe in the importance of making wellness personal and relevant for employees . A few key events include:

GO RED fOR HEART HEALTH
In support of our partnership with the American Heart Association and to promote heart health in the workplace, we launched our company-wide Go Red campaign in 2006. Each February, workplace activities are based on four pillars -- Engage, Educate, Move, and Go Red -- and are designed to address heart disease risks. Activities include: · The Annual AdDRESS Your Heart employee fashion show. Employees design their own costumes based on the iconic Campbell logo and brands to promote heart health · Health screenings, lectures, and Go Red walks to promote physical activity · Heart healthy recipe contest and discussions on healthy eating · Organized walking tours and other exercise events

Work/Life flexibility
Campbell understands the pressures and challenges our employees face as they balance work with personal interests and responsibilities . We also understand that our employees are better able to meet the demands of the business when their personal needs are being met . When it comes to work/life flexibility, we believe a "one-size-fits-all" approach simply won't do . Our programs are designed to recognize that not all employees are the same and that their needs may change over time . Our programs also reflect country and local differences . In response to employee needs, Campbell offers a range of flexible work arrangements, including telecommuting, flex-time, job-share, and reduced and compressed work weeks .

Diversity and Inclusion
Creating and marketing products effectively to an increasingly diverse world requires a strong commitment to diversity in every aspect of our business. Our company-wide diversity efforts encourage all employees to bring their uniqueness and individuality to work every day.
We believe that building a diverse and inclusive culture is critical to winning in the workplace, marketplace, and in the community . That is why our Diversity and Inclusion strategy (illustrated below) closely aligns with the Campbell Success Model . Today, Campbell has an overall representation of 40% women and 34% people of color in the U .S . While we have also seen an increase in representation of women and people of color in the executive ranks, we continue to be challenged with retaining diverse employees at lower levels of management . Improving in this area is a priority across our organization, brought to life through our active recruiting with associations (e .g ., Consortium, Reaching Out MBA, Costco Minority Scholars) .

CO M M U N I T Y

While employee representation is important, we believe it is only the foundation for a dynamically diverse and inclusive environment . To build on this foundation, company-wide initiatives are executed with five goals in mind: 1. firmly establish leadership support and accountability: Senior leaders are responsible for participating in at least one diversity and inclusion training session and for leading a diversity and inclusion activity within the organization . Each Business Resource Affinity Network (BRAN) has an executive sponsor and senior leaders participate in activities such as the Diversity Book Club . 2. Link diversity and inclusion to performance management: Employees at all levels must identify and reach a diversity and inclusion objective, documented on their performance review form, each year . They can participate in any activity that helps to create, manage, value, or leverage a diverse workforce (e .g ., organizing a diversity-focused teambuilding activity, seeking out female or minority-owned suppliers) .

3. Integrate diversity and inclusion into talent management: Recruiting, developing, and retaining women and people of color is a priority for our business . 4. Build diversity and inclusion into business practices: Our supplier diversity initiative has grown significantly since its inaugural year in 2006 with an increasing goal each year . 5. Educate and train to advance diversity and inclusion: All employees have access to online and classroom diversity and inclusion training, and may participate in educational events about diverse cultures . Our training offerings have expanded from one classroom-based training session in FY2006 to four classroom-based courses and an eLearning class that is adapted for U .S . and international audiences . U .S . participation in diversity and inclusion training sessions increased from 1,040 in FY2006 to 2,965 in FY2009 .

Winning with Women
Campbell received the 2010 Catalyst Award for our success in advancing women to leadership roles, a critical part of the company's overall workplace and marketplace transformation . The annual Catalyst Award honors exceptional initiatives from companies and firms that demonstrate the strong business case supporting women's advancement to leadership and positions of influence by employing best practices around diversity, inclusion, and employee engagement . Campbell was recognized for its "Winning in the Workplace, Winning in the Marketplace, Winning with Women" submission, which used employee engagement, knowledge sharing, diversity and inclusion, and innovation to support the company's overall transformation plan . The award was based on many factors, including strong improvements from 2005­2009 in the following areas: · Women'srepresentationontheBoardofDirectorsgrewto20%from13%. · Womeninexecutiverolesgrewto25%from21%. · Inmanufacturingroles,thepercentageofwomenplantdirectorsandmanagersincreasedto21%from14%. · WomenplayasignificantroleinleadingkeyfunctionsincludingLegalandGovernmentalAffairs,HumanResources,and Diversity and Inclusion .

Diversity and Inclusion in Action
While our Diversity and Inclusion efforts originally began in the U .S ., over the last several years, we've seen these efforts expand across the globe . A few examples include:

ASIAN NETWORK EMPLOYEES SUPPORT BUSINESS PROMOTION
When Campbell hosted Chinese government officials at its World Headquarters in summer 2009, the Asian Network of Campbell stepped forward to assist. Four employees fluent in Mandarin served as translators during the visit of China Inspection and Quarantine (CIQ) agency representatives. Their skills were crucial in facilitating this mutually beneficial visit -- Campbell promoted Swanson broth to influential members of this emerging market while the CIQ learned more about U.S. food safety practices.

DIvERSITY BOOK CLUB OPENS THE DIALOGUE
The Diversity Book Club provides a forum for employees to discuss diversity issues and to learn from their colleagues' perspectives. The Book Club has over 500 employees at multiple locations. Groups of approximately 15 employees, which often include senior leaders and even CEO Doug Conant, meet monthly to discuss a book focused on diversity in the workplace. Discussions are guided by Campbell employees who volunteer to facilitate.

ON-SITE MOSQUE AT INDONESIA PLANT
The Al Maa'idah Mosque was opened in Indonesia to accommodate employees' religious on-site needs. The Mosque, built in 2008, can accommodate 230 people.

AWARD-WINNING EffORTS
Internally and externally we are gaining recognition for our work to build an extraordinarily diverse and inclusive culture. Doug Conant's work in this area was recognized in 2008 by Diversity Best Practices with the CEO Leadership Award.

Business Resource Affinity Networks (BRANs)
While open to all employees, BRANs provide a valuable forum for employees from similar backgrounds and interests to network, develop professionally, promote cultural awareness, encourage community involvement, and provide mutual support . The networks also help us attract and retain a diverse group of employees and enhance understanding of the consumer marketplace . A member of the CEO's Executive Leadership Team serves as a sponsor for each of the following BRANs: Campbell African American Network: Positively impact Campbell's business results, employee engagement, and employee retention by empowering, nurturing, building a culture of connectedness, and providing a forum to elevate visibility .

Supplier Diversity
To effectively respond to today's diverse marketplace, we must strive for diversity not only among our employees and consumers, but also in our supplier base . Our U .S . supplier diversity mission is to grant diverse suppliers equal access to potential business opportunities in an effort to strengthen our supplier base and reflect the markets we serve . These relationships strengthen our competitive position while contributing to our market share, our total shareholder return, and to the quality of life in the communities where we live and work . Simply stated, there is no other way for us to effectively create and market consumer food products in an increasingly multicultural world . We firmly believe that diverse suppliers have a positive impact on our business, consumers, and community .

Safety
Campbell aspires to reach lost-time and injury rates of zero, and continues to drive performance to eliminate potential risks in the workplace.
Campbell's Global Safety Leadership Team (GSLT) was created in 2003 to develop and implement a Global Safety Strategic Plan with the ultimate goal of providing a safe and injury-free workplace . This team, along with cross-functional safety committees at each location, helps implement standardized safety practices across the company and facilitate the sharing of best practices to improve overall safety . We aggressively and thoroughly evaluate workplace incidents, review our practices and take proactive measures to address emerging issues . Our efforts have led to a 59% reduction in lost workday injury rates over the past three fiscal years at our facilities . Our safety performance has also exceeded food industry benchmarks for the past three years (illustrated below) .

Beyond tracking and improving injuries and illnesses, we believe it is important to recognize our employees as they reach important safety milestones . Campbell has implemented the Safety Flag Program to recognize key safety milestones at our locations . This program honors Campbell facilities where safety systems have kept all employees safe from lost-time injuries on the job for at least one year or one million work hours . The location is given a flag to display at their plant or facility when they reach this milestone . Today, 20 of Campbell's more than 30 sites proudly fly the Safety Flag, many with gold Campbell "C"s added for reaching additional million-hour milestones . Special flags are given to plants that have experienced no lost-time incidents (LTIs) . Campbell's Global Safety Excellence Award recognizes up to three Campbell facilities each year for their ongoing efforts to instill a concern for workplace safety into their cultures . Plants are evaluated based on a number of criteria, including: 1. Demonstrated safety results 2. Sustained safety systems 3. Achieving continued injury reduction 4. Safety leadership 5.

Resource Stewardship in Our Operations
Environmental resource management strategy, focus areas and results
Energy Management and Proactive Climate Actions
As a food company that relies on high-quality agricultural products, we must be aware of and be prepared operationally for the risks posed by climate change . We have completed a number of initiatives that have reduced our energy use and greenhouse gas emissions globally in the last two years . Examples of some of these energy conservation programs include reducing the electricity required for plant lighting by installing more energy-efficient systems, reducing fuel use by installing heat-recovery systems, and reducing water and steam demand by recycling water from the product cooling process . We are continuing our long-standing efforts to reduce the amount of energy and water use per case of finished product . Teams of plant personnel have implemented strategies that have reduced energy requirements of our manufacturing process . Further modifications are being implemented to support this effort and drive future performance improvements . We now produce a case of soup with 19% less energy than we did 10 years ago . In August 2006, Campbell joined the U .S . Environmental Protection Agency Climate Leaders program, a national voluntary effort to reduce GHG emissions . As a Climate Leader partner, we have committed our energy conservation and GHG reduction program to: · Trackandreport100%oftheemissionsfromfacilitiesandoperationsoverwhichCampbellhascontrol · InventorythesixmajorGHGgasesandreportprogressannuallybasedontheEPAprotocolsandguidance · DevelopacorporateGHGinventorymanagementplanbasedontheEPAchecklistthatinstitutionalizestheinventoryprocess · ReduceourGHGemissionsfromourU.Soperationsby12%percaseofproductproducedbytheendofourFY2010versusa FY2005 baseline Over the past three years, we have implemented the Climate Leaders protocol to develop the systems needed to track our energy use and the resulting direct and indirect GHG emissions . These systems have been verified by the U .S . EPA as an accurate means of monitoring and tracking GHG emissions . The following charts outline the results achieved against the baseline year of FY2005:

Water Stewardship
Water is an integral component in the production of all food and beverages . At Campbell, we use water in the creation of many of our products, as well as for cleaning, cooking, and even vegetable transport within our plants . Maintaining a clean and reliable supply of water is essential both to the future of the company and the future of the communities in which we operate . All of our manufacturing plants have implemented water conservation measures and have established systems to ensure that the water used in our operations is appropriately cleaned and treated before it is returned to the environment . We use water to wash ingredients, cool finished products, satisfy our steam requirements, clean and sanitize our operations, and as an ingredient in our products . All Campbell operations provide wastewater treatment through the use of either a company-owned treatment system or through pretreatment prior to discharge to a municipal-owned treatment works . We apply a stewardship philosophy when it comes to water . We seek to advance conservation across our enterprise, returning clean and appropriately treated water to our local communities following our use . The following chart summarizes our global water use over the past two fiscal years .

Waste Management
We apply a consistent approach to managing the waste generated in our offices and plant operations . We apply a hierarchy to our decision-making process of reduce, reuse, and recycle in our operations to minimize the impact our production has on the environment and help reduce our total costs . We implement strategic initiatives to reduce the various waste streams from our operations . Efforts such as reducing the amount of food manufacturing waste and reusing waste product as either an animal feed or compost has reduced the amount of waste we send to local landfills . Campbell offices around the world have supported our goal of reducing waste by implementing programs to minimize the use of office paper and recycle waste from our office areas . In Campbell World Headquarters alone, a consolidated effort has reduced office supply shipments by 50% and cut paper usage 12% from 2008 to 2009 . That translates into 40 fewer tons of paper used and more than 240,000 pounds of CO2 not released during the paper's production, according to PaperCalculator .org .

Material Reuse and Recycling
Closed-loop options and beneficial reuse principles guide our thinking when it comes to recycling materials . Part of this effort has included the diversion of off-specification product from local landfills to a facility that crushes the container, recycles the container, and reuses the food material as animal feed ingredients . We also continue to expand our comprehensive recycling programs as we strive to achieve our worldwide 95% recycle rate goal . The current programs to recycle food waste, corrugated paper, steel drums, office paper, plastic, fluorescent tubes, batteries, wood pallets, and scrap metal are all being evaluated to ensure maximum efficiency .

B RYAN Mc K AY d i s c u ss e s C a mp b e l l 's G l obal Packagi ng Sus t ai nabi l i t y Fr am ew or k This year, Bryan McKay, packaging director of Campbell Arnott's Asia Pacific, was part of the team that developed Campbell's Global Packaging Sustainability Framework, a series of principles, strategies, and objectives that will frame all future packaging development programs globally. "In going through this process, we realized that many packaging projects already underway at Campbell could deliver a better sustainability footprint for our products," said McKay, who is based in Sydney, Australia and has worked for Campbell Arnott's for seven years. "When collated, the results are significant and will positively impact our environment." For example, by making simple redesigns to existing packaging, Campbell reduced steel usage by more than 3.5 million pounds and paper/board usage by more than 1 million pounds globally. McKay's department also designs and develops packing for new products, meaning future product packaging will be assessed under these new criteria. Going forward, McKay's team is working with key suppliers to investigate other areas where they can reduce waste. For example, they're looking at using renewable and biodegradable packaging materials, including post-consumer recycled materials in beverage bottles, further reducing metal container weights, and employing packing and processes to improve baked goods shelf life and reduce waste. Said McKay, "This framework gives us the direction to change our focus and efforts on driving packaging sustainability at Campbell."

Sustainable Packaging Guidelines
In FY2009, our packaging professionals developed formal packaging sustainability guidelines to help inform decisions associated with the packaging materials used to protect the wide range of our products . These guidelines translate industry best practices into a set of guiding principles . · Deliver75%ofglobalpackagingfromsustainablematerials(renewable,recyclable,orfromrecycledcontent) · Obtain50%ofcompanyrevenuefromproductsutilizingpackagingwithanimprovedenvironmentalfootprint(material reduction and/or substitution and supply chain efficiencies) We have established new 2020 targets for our global packaging efforts . In 2010, we will review our data sets worldwide and consult with leading sustainable packaging organizations in which we hold membership, including the Sustainable Packaging Coalition and the Australia National Packaging Covenant Council (NPCC), to define a set of baseline metrics . Also in 2010, Pepperidge Farm plans to finish the conversion of all its dry carton packaging to 100% recycled content . Campbell is a member of the Consumer Goods Forum Global Packaging Project (GPP) . The GPP launched a partnership of major manufacturers and retailers to define and pilot a new common language of definitions to measure the sustainability of packaging .

Packaging Challenges
One topic that has received attention in the media recently has been the use of a material called bisphenol A (BPA) . BPA is used in a broad array of household and consumer products . The lining of most metal food containers used to prevent corrosion and help maintain the food's safety, quality, and flavor also can contain residual amounts of BPA . The compound has a long history of safe use in many plastics and has been approved for use in food packaging by all global regulatory agencies that have reviewed it .

Campbell's primary consideration, now and always, is the safety of the people who purchase our products . We adhere to the guidance of the U .S . FDA and comply with the packaging requirements of global regulatory agencies . Leading scientific and regulatory agencies the world over have thoroughly reviewed numerous tests and studies and reaffirmed that BPA is safe for food packaging . Nonetheless, there are additional scientific studies underway to ensure the safety of BPA in food packaging . We welcome this additional research and will continue to monitor these scientific studies closely, basing any necessary changes in our packaging on their findings and conclusions . We go to great lengths to make sure Campbell's products are safe for families to enjoy . Providing high-quality food and beverages that are safe to eat and drink has been our top priority for 140 years . Our packaging has always -- and will always -- comply with applicable safety standards .

Sustainable Agriculture
Working with farmers and applying comprehensive agricultural science to advance the state of sustainable agriculture
Campbell continues to work closely with the farmers who grow our agricultural ingredients to expand our sustainable agricultural practices and programs . We strive to reduce the impact that these practices have on the environment, while enhancing practices that benefit wildlife and promote biodiversity . By promoting biological diversity through systematic crop rotation and preserving wetlands and natural drainage through habitat management, we reduce the effects of soil erosion, conserve water, and improve overall watershed management health . Through our involvement as a member of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization's regional vegetable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, we are finding ways of improving our internal programs and extending our impact beyond our contract growers . We have made significant advances in our sustainable agriculture efforts over the past 20 years . Campbell encourages better water management practices, including drip irrigation and retention basins to reduce runoff and conserve water . Our contract growers have implemented conservation tillage to reduce fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions . Our researchers have developed disease-resistant varieties to reduce pesticide usage and have advanced environmentally friendly integrated pestmanagement programs . Almost every effort has the potential to improve multiple areas of stewardship . Changing climate is expected to have large and far-reaching effects on crop productivity as well as on pests and diseases affecting the cultivated crops . To address these changes, Campbell has teamed with the University of California at Davis (UC Davis) to use computer models backed by field experiments to identify optimal water and nitrogen use, and develop weather-based predictive systems for the key disease and insect pests for which pesticides are routinely used to create better IPM strategies .

Actions and Initiatives
Our goal is to be the sector leader in sustainable agricultural practices and Integrated Pest Management . We have established new long-term goals to reduce water use by 20% and energy use by 30% per pound of ingredient grown of our top agricultural ingredients -- tomatoes, carrots, celery, mushroom, and jalapeño peppers -- by 2020 . Working with our largest suppliers and organizations such as the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, and continuing our close relationship with UC Davis, we are developing programs and practices that will help us and our contract growers meet these challenges . In FY2010, we are putting renewed emphasis on this area to establish new performance baselines upon which to build future metrics . Our specific priorities are outlined below: Our Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives for FY2010 include: · SupportingincreasedIntegratedPestManagementandreducingsyntheticpesticideusage · ParticipatinginProcessingTomatoFoundationCaliforniawatermetricsgroup · Focusingonprocessingtomato-waterconservation · PromotingtomatoingredienttransportationfleetupgradesforimprovedmileageandGHGreduction · Documentingandpromotingingredientplantenergyconservationinitiativesthatreducewaterandenergyusepertonne of ingredient · Drivingimprovementsintoourreturnablebulkpackagingreuseprogram

Supply Chain, Logistics, and Transportation
How Campbell manages aspects of sourcing our products and getting them to the store shelf, including procurement and distribution
The Campbell global supply chain organization is responsible for all aspects of producing our products and getting them to the store shelf . This includes procurement, engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance, and distribution functions . About twothirds of our employees work within the supply chain organization at different headquarters locations or at one of the more than 30 manufacturing plants the company has around the world . These employees work in collaboration with our suppliers, research and development, business teams, and trade partners to optimize the supply chain from beginning to end . Key measures of success include safety, quality, total delivered cost (TDC), environmental sustainability, and customer service .

MARY L O N G d i s c u ss e s t h e s u st a i n a b il i t y benefi t s of l ogi s t i cs opt i m i zat i on For Director of Collaborative Supply Chain Solutions Mary Long, saving fuel, time, money, and along the way, the environment, is almost like a series of puzzles. She moves pieces around, finding the best fits. She uses math and logic to find ways to cut costs. "Logistics optimization is all about being green and inherently sustainable," said Long, who has spent six years with Campbell. "It's not really rocket science: You want to travel fewer miles, move more weight when you can and partner creatively." Long oversees a variety of functions, including transportation, warehousing, and customer operations. This year, her department found ways to make small changes that had big impact. The goal is to continue and increase these changes in the next year, ultimately aiming to reduce the company's CO2 impact by 20% by 2012. Take freight utilization, which means putting more weight on an individual trailer so there are fewer trucks on the roads. One way that Campbell did that this year is by switching to a transport company that uses trucks constructed of lighter materials. That means those vehicles can carry more product. In one case, those efforts reduced the number of vehicles on the road from 15,000 to 12,000, Long said. "That's good for the customer and good for us," Long said. "It takes trailers and trucks off the road completely. You have 3,000 trucks that aren't on the road or tying up dock time." In another case of "a little goes a long way," Supply Chain Solutions found that it could add four pallets of mushrooms to each load going to the Maxton, North Carolina plant that makes cream of mushroom soup. That took 20% of the mushroom vehicles off the road. In addition, we have a goal to reload every inbound delivery to our plants with an outbound shipment. In FY2009 this eliminated 1.2MM "deadhead" miles -- i.e., miles when trucks are traveling empty. Creative partnerships with customers can also make a difference. Campbell offers incentive pricing to reward customers who send in optimized weight orders, cutting down on the number of partially filled trucks on the road. Small customers as well as larger ones are taking advantage of the costs savings, she said. A creative collaboration with another customer has the customer's trucks leaving its headquarters, picking up a delivery for Campbell along the way then dropping off its load at Campbell and being reloaded with soup to take back to its home base. That reduces empty miles and is cost effective, said Long. "It's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it's a win for the environment, and that's a beautiful thing."

Results and Initiatives
Campbell Soup Company continues to implement projects aimed at reducing the environmental impact associated with the delivery of ingredients to our facilities and the distribution of finished products to our customers . Our manufacturing facilities continue to produce approximately 93% of all Campbell-labeled products . One significant sustainability advantage Campbell maintains is that many container manufacturing operations are adjacent to our food production plants . By operating container manufacturing operations for both cans and plastic bottles in plants that are directly attached to our major food manufacturing plants, we eliminate the need to expend energy shipping empty containers from remote locations . This makes tremendous improvement to what some refer to as the "embedded environmental impacts" of products . Below are examples of other supply chain projects that further reduce the energy required to deliver our finished product: · IntheU.S.,wehaveadoptedtheuseoflighter-weightequipment,increasingpayloadcapacityto53,000pounds.This resulted in taking the equivalent of 1,700 trucks off the road, saving 230,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and eliminating more than 1 million miles traveled in the Campbell distribution network . · IntheU.S.,palletoptimizationprojectsonourinboundrawmaterialsandingredientshaveincreasedthenumberofpallets per truckload and taken an additional 160 trucks off the road . · InAustralia,Campbellpackagingprofessionalsredesignedboththeproductcasesandpalletpatterns,resultingina reduction in 440,000 pounds of cardboard and eliminating 100,000 truck miles from the Campbell distribution network . · CampbellCanadianpackagingprofessionalsredesignedpalletstackingpatterns,saving78,000poundsofcardboardand removing 750 trucks distributing product from the road in Canada . · Throughtheuseofintermodal(truckandrail)distribution,fuelconsumptionandCO2 emissions were reduced up to 50% versus conventional truck distribution, allowing us to reduce the number of trucks on the road and save approximately 2,100,000 gallons of diesel fuel .

Building a Robust Supplier Base
One of our primary objectives is marketing safe products of consistent quality that meet or exceed our customer and consumer expectations . We recognize that our suppliers and other business partners play a critical role in helping us execute our mission and our commitment to sustainability in an ethical and responsible manner . Thus, they must share the same objectives . Campbell's Supply Base Expectations Manual identifies the expectations and requirements of all firms that are, and aspire to be, a Campbell supplier . The requirements detailed in the manual are designed to help our current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses, and licensees meet these objectives . We consider adherence and performance to these expectations as essential factors when entering or extending existing business relationships . In FY2009, we developed a sustainability scorecard that was shared with our largest suppliers . Using their feedback, we will develop appropriate measures to track and reward advancing sustainability performance among Campbell suppliers . We also are seeking to build a system that supports the growing interest among our customers in understanding the sustainability impacts within the supply chain . In our most recent revision, we have integrated new advanced expectations into the manual that address employee health and safety, environmental performance, and human rights . New suppliers are categorized by risk, utilizing a process documented in our Global Supplier Policy . The policy defines requirements for ongoing monitoring of performance and food safety systems audits against recognized standards as well as those that are conducted by an independent third party . Based on risk categorization and supplier performance, we also conduct site audits of those suppliers in higher-risk categories to verify compliance and execute corrective action plans .

Independent Review Statement
Campbell Soup Company's 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report -- BSR Review Letter
Campbell Soup Company requested that BSR conduct an independent review of its Corporate Social Responsibility Report covering activities and performance in 2009 . We highlight areas of strengths and challenges, and suggest ways that future reports can address the complex set of issues facing Campbell Soup . It should be noted that our review neither verifies nor expresses an opinion on the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of information provided in this report . Significant strengths and achievements include: In-depth coverage of selected issues The Report provides a comprehensive look at a number of key issues facing Campbell Soup, including its success in enhancing the health profile of its product lines and efforts to address hunger and obesity in the communities where it does business . Particularly notable has been its achievement in the area of health and nutrition . All food companies face these complex issues, and we believe that the information in the Report will allow stakeholders to make informed decisions about Campbell Soup's programs and objectives . Clear description of CSR strategy and programs, and 2020 goals Campbell Soup has developed a thorough CSR strategy and the underlying governance framework and programs to implement it, and the Report uses clear language to describe them . Also impressive are its 2020 CSR goals, which are bold and as such will entail significant challenges . We look forward in future reports to more detail as to how these goals will be achieved and to Campbell Soup's progress . Solid progress built on 2008 CSR report The Report shows marked improvement from last year's, especially in the areas of strategy, metrics, and completeness . In addition, the description of the CSR management system is a welcome addition, and it provides a clear sense of how Campbell Soup will manage its environmental and social responsibilities going forward . In future reports, we encourage Campbell Soup to: Increase focus on selected material CSR issues Campbell Soup has conducted a materiality analysis that has defined and prioritized its most important CSR opportunities and challenges . We believe that the most critical CSR issues have been identified, and encourage a continued and deeper examination of sustainability in the areas of packaging, agriculture production, and supply chain management . Each area offers significant possibilities for reducing risk and achieving a leading position in CSR performance within the food industry . In addition, we believe that a more in-depth discussion should be presented on the outcomes of Campbell Soup's stakeholder engagement efforts . Leading companies are increasingly using stakeholder engagement as a means to assess market positioning, product developments, and enterprise risk, and providing more detail around stakeholder viewpoints and perspectives would add value to the Report . At the same time, we would welcome a more focused discussion of the company's wide-ranging community outreach activities, including those addressing obesity and hunger .

Balance discussion of successes and challenges A hallmark of the most highly regarded CSR reports is the open recognition of difficult environmental, social, and governance problems . Although Campbell Soup has many successful CSR programs and initiatives to highlight, we would also like to see discussion of its key challenges in the areas of health & wellness, community outreach, and management of its supply chain from farm to consumer . Evolve reporting approach CSR reporting is an important component of a company's engagement with internal and external stakeholders . Companies are increasingly experimenting with a combination of print, online, social networking, and other interactive media to communicate their commitments, programs, and performance . We encourage Campbell Soup to continue development of web-based reporting that will allow stakeholders to access basic information in an efficient manner, while at the same time leveraging more interactive and innovative approaches to convey key strategies, goals, and performance trends . Summary Food companies arguably face a wider array of CSR challenges than those in any other industry . Greater transparency and the likely intensification of critical global issues such as climate change, food security, water availability, and health & wellness, will increase the pressure on the food industry to demonstrate that its CSR programs are both meaningful and effective . Building on the foundation of its strategic plan for addressing environmental, social, and governance issues, Campbell Soup has the opportunity to utilize its CSR report as a primary communication tool in order to strengthen its brand and demonstrate to the food industry that sustainability is perfectly aligned with profitability .
