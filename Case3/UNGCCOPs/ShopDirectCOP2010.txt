the united nations global Compact (ungC) is the world's largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative. The UNGC issues Ten Principles on Human Rights, Labour Standards, the Environment and Corruption. Membership of the UNGC requires companies to issue a `Communication on Progress' report annually. This report is our fourth COP and it outlines Shop Direct Group's activities in support of these Ten Principles.

throughout this report you will find a marking scheme in each section. The purpose of this scheme is for us to rate how well we think we are performing in each reporting area by highlighting a tab, ranging from legal compliance to best practice. Where we have not marked ourselves as best practice or good, we intend to raise standards accordingly. In deciding on indicators for this COP once again we have chosen our own system. Nevertheless, this was done after using as reference the Ethos Indicators and GRI methodology. Moreover, we continue to monitor best practice in the CR and sustainability reporting industry and adapt our own indicators and reporting accordingly. bEST PRaCTICE GOOD

Welcome to all readers of our fourth annual communication on progress covering the year 2009. The past year has been rather difficult with regard to trading and the global economic downturn has impacted our business. Nevertheless, we are fully committed to achieving the very best possible standards in our CR program, our investment has increased and we have clearly demonstrated progress in many areas since our last report. This report is divided into sections outlining our actions in support of the ten principles. Each section has a sponsor from our leadership team who is responsible for maintaining progress over the year. We continue to press on with addressing our Future Focus Ten priorities which are governed by the Group CR Board. I am pleased to chair the CR Board myself and grateful to each of the board members for guiding the CR strategy over the past year. We also supported the Compact as Chair of the UN GC UK Network through 2009 and helped create a thriving network of corporate members eager to abide by the ten principles. Please enjoy reading this report and I would be delighted to receive your feedback. questionmark@shopdirect.com

respect for the global Compact principles binds together our activities in Cr and sustainability and gives us a simple to use and simple to understand framework for action and measurement. Reporting on the Ten Principles ensures we report comprehensively across all our business impacts. The writing of a COP increases our competitiveness as it serves as a public and very visible record of progress and therefore focuses our actions and planning in multiple business critical areas. The production of a COP has also aided employee understanding of our business and by mapping our impacts has helped identify cost savings and opportunities to increase efficiencies particularly in the area of carbon reduction. We also believe that the adoption and respect of the Ten Principles gives us a renewed licence to operate among the communities within which we work, as well as with our customers, staff, suppliers and wider stakeholders.

labour PrinCiPles
in 2009 we have brought additional focus and resource to our ethical sourcing team and have thereby made great progress in extending our activities in support of Principles 2, 4 & 5. The SDG supply chain remains geographically similar to the previous year and the emergence of new manufacturing countries e.g. Egypt has been slower than anticipated and not significantly impacted our business. However, we are planning an increasing proportion of manufacturing across our ranges within Europe due to strategic advantages including quality, efficiency and lead times. This should impact favourably on our ability to support principles 2,4 and 5 going forward into 2010. Please allow me to present our main activities in support of Principles 2, 4 & 5 in 2009.

We do this by careful risk management of our supply chain and by a process of factory monitoring. During 2009 we maintained our policy of not sourcing in burma due to widespread human rights abuses. We are listed on the UK burma Campaign's Clean List. Moreover, we do not source from any country where there are UN trade sanctions or embargoes.

Our Code of Conduct which is signed by all suppliers states the following: "We will not tolerate forced labour, bonded labour or labour which involves physical or mental abuse. This means that suppliers must not use or threaten workers with any physical punishment, verbal or sexual harassment or dominate or restrain workers by force, authority or threats. Workers must not be required to lodge "deposits" or their identity papers with their employer and they must be free to leave their employer after reasonable notice." No serious cases of forced labour were found by the SDG monitoring programme in 2009.

PROJECTED
the effective abolition of child labour is taken very seriously by sdg. Our Code of Conduct which (as previously stated) is signed by all suppliers, clearly explains our position on child labour as follows: "Exploitation of child labour is totally unacceptable under any circumstances. Suppliers must not employ any person under the minimum legal working age applicable to their country and under no circumstances must they employ anybody under the age of 14 years." On the rare occasions we have found child labour in factories in the past we have worked with independent expert advisors to find tailor-made solutions. In 2009 no cases of child labour were found by the SDG monitoring program

monitoring
in 2009 the group Cr board ratified the following KPi: "All suppliers factories responsible for the production of Shop Direct Group own-brand direct product will be ethically and environmentally audited according to a process of risk assessment every two years" Having started the program at the beginning of 2008 I'm pleased to report that we achieved our KPI and audited all direct factories (product sourced through Source Direct International Ltd) by Dec 2009 This included factories in UK, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Syria, India, bangladesh, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Please note: although we audit all UK factories we do not normally audit factories producing for SDG in

We over-achieved on our goal for compliance at 80% and achieved a year end score of just under 100%. Using a Hot-List which was managed centrally we managed to ensure that all factories that were breaking our code either lost their contracts (after due process) or were improved. This successful outcome is an excellent reflection on our CR audit team who continue to make sacrifices by spending up to 20 weeks a year travelling away from their families on company business. Our three CR managers see CR as a vocation and not merely a job.

In 2010 the monitoring program will enter a new "revisit" stage to ensure that compliant factories continue to improve and do not fall back into non-compliance. also of note is the fact that we will continue to share audits with other retailers and brands whenever possible to decrease the burden of time and resources on all involved. although we retain the right to conduct worker interviews we will only normally do this with freelyelected trade union representatives where available.

animal welfare
bEST PRaCTICE we maintain a strict policy on the use of fur and skins based on industry best practice. The policy is available on our supplier website and was re-issued amongst a new suite of Sourcing policies in 2009.

ConClusion
in 2009 the audit team galvanised and extended all resources to achieve an exceptional result of just short of 100% compliance in our direct supply chain. the challenge is on for 2010 to ensure that we continue to achieve optimum results for our direct suppliers. There should be continuous improvement and if there are issues and suppliers fall back from previously achieved ethical standards then they should be managed back to compliance by the CR team and commercial teams jointly. This will no doubt be difficult to achieve in some cases given the turbulent global economy and a number of external pressures on suppliers including increasing commodity prices. Furthermore, we aim to extend our program to cover those suppliers that we deal with indirectly i.e. not via SDIL (our wholly owned sourcing operation). This will prove a major challenge for the team but is necessary if we wish to move towards a `level playing field'. I hope the inclusion of an extract from the blogs of Macy, Ratan and Mike will give an insight into the world of the ethical auditor. For now these blogs are only available to colleagues but we have plans in 2010 to build a public CR website and will give Macy, Mike and Ratan centre stage on the ethical sourcing pages. alongside our monitoring programme our product sourcing working groups (Cotton & Timber) continue to bear fruit and will be joined by additional initiatives annually. Moreover, we will build on our Child Labour project in Morocco with similar initiatives further into our supply chain in India.

sdg remains committed to involvement in Cr projects. In 2009 we further developed our `Moses basket' project in Morocco which assessed whether Child Labour was involved in the production of our own brand baby baskets in rural mountain villages. Happily this was not the case but we did make clear recommendations regarding wage legislation for home-workers to the local United Nations representative, as well as relevant agencies of the Moroccan Government.

We continue to work on ethical product sourcing initiatives building on the successes achieved with our organic cotton and FSC furniture ranges. In 2009 we convened a working group on Diamond Sourcing to ensure that we are not complicit in the sale of conflict diamonds. The result was a ratified Group policy on diamond sourcing and a written guarantee (referencing the Kimberley process) which was signed by all our diamond suppliers. Following our working group and further investigations we are confident that no conflict diamonds are used in the production of SDG jewellery.

miKe's blog in his own words...
Im happy to report that in 2009 the EMEa (Europe Middle East & africa) audit function went well with very few Red graded factories and lots of progress made. Monitoring of U.K. operations also remains important. To illustrate the process please read through this overview of my recent work schedule. I have recently visited two factories with differing outcomes. Factory a is a textile factory in Turkey. approximately 20% of their turnover is with Shop Direct. The factory documentation was absolutely first class but the reality in the factory was somewhat different. The factory could not be described as dangerous but housekeeping was poor and they had emergency lighting only in limited areas. also additional warning signage was needed for safety equipment including ear defenders. I held a discussion with management to discuss my concerns. The audit Report has been sent to them and currently they have been graded amber. Factory b is a re-processing, warehouse & distribution centre based in Manchester in the north-west of England. They are a new supplier manufacturing children's clothing in China and then dispatching from their UK hub. Once again although

documentation was good there were other areas identified for improvement. On entering the shop floor it was quite congested with no aisle marking. I was concerned that the distance at the far end of the building to the fire exits appeared to be quite far. It was then that I became aware that a fire exit door had become completely obscured by boxes awaiting despatch. as a result, the unit has been scored Red. a re-visit is planned within 3 months to assess progress. Moreover, I have asked Macy Liao in our China team to consider conducting an audit of their Chinese production unit. My job is a series of challenges and problems to solve but all in all its what I enjoy doing. No one day is the same and I have to keep on my toes. Still as a former Factory Manager with 30+ years experience in the trade, its refreshing to get the chance to help improve the conditions at production units with which we work on a day to day basis. In 2010, my role will extend to cover audit management of the factories in the Far East that work with us but not through our own sourcing house. It's a big undertaking and there will no doubt be twists and turns on the way but I am looking forward to it.

maCy's blog in her own words...
all in all, 258 audits involving management and worker interviews, document review, facilities inspection and training were conducted at different levels in our supplying chain throughout the year 2009. This comprised 185 full audits and 73 follow up audits. 90% of our follow up audits are concerned with Red graded factories. We attend up to a maximum three times to help and assist factory management to comply with our code of conduct. There may be issues with transparency e.g. to disclose real documents, to pay workers more, to provide improved working conditions for workers or even to improve environmental performance.¬ This is detailed work needs and needs patience and tenacity and assertiveness. Luckily these are qualities which my team possesses! We are also supported by the top management of company as well as merchandisers and the Quality (Qa/ QC) team. During the last year, we successfully concentrated more orders in good factories, stayed away from the factories that did not demonstrated willingness to improve and focussed solely on factories that are always moving forward. at the close of the 2009, we were proud to say

that all of our suppliers have been ethically and environmentally audited and we have a minimum compliance grading of amber giving us 100% compliance in China. In 2010 I feel my work will become even more important. There is a lack of improvement in factory conditions when there are tough economic times. No Company becomes fully ethical or sustainable overnight. Individual people can be inspired in a moment to take action or to be engaged in the debate. but for a company as a whole, it is a long journey. Good to know that we as a team and as a company are already on the road.

ratan's blog in his own words...
namaste (hello)! It is time again to jot down our deeds and achievements for the past year....well...2009 was a mixed bag of good and bad....but then achievement always comes with some positive and negatives in it. For 2009, we had completed 173 audits including the Potential, live factories across the Indian subcontinent, bangladesh and Southeast asia. The past year has been more like running through the time and challenges as we were given a target date to complete visiting and final revisiting of all RED rated factories. Sad to say, not all the RED rated factories were able to achieve at least the aMbER rating and thus resulting in the suspension of some in the supply chain. at the end of 2009, we were able to filter a larger portion of the Non-Compliant factories or those who failed to achieve at least the minimum aMbER rating which is a must requirement for SDIL to go forward and do the business. Disengagement was the last option for us...we had worked and tried to work within the company to achieve at least the minimum requirement....but.....not all were able to prove their commitment to change and improvement.

Nevertheless, we are happy to report that in 2009 with the support of the top management, and with valuable guidance from our SDG colleagues, we were able to achieve our target.

throughout 2009 we have continued to strive forward in the 4 elements within `future focus 10' that my team manage; energy Consumption, recycling, transport and Health & safety. our strong focus on energy consumption has resulted in delivery of some excellent initiatives. as a result we have reduced energy consumption in each of the last 4 years. the challenge remains for us to continue to reduce our consumption year on year over the next 5 years and beyond as the uK Carbon reduction Commitment scheme comes into force. with this in mind we have established a Carbon reduction team from all areas of the business to share best practice and work together on a coherent strategy. by introducing further recycling measures and utilising new waste separation and recycling facilities, sought out by our team, we have increased our percentage of recycling significantly in 2009. looking at transport, we have also managed to reduce our C02 emissions by utilising phone and video conferencing more frequently as well as encouraging the use of public transport and car sharing as a way of reducing our environmental impact from travelling into and between our places of work. in Health & safety, highlights have included british standard 18001 accreditation for our Head office and Contact Centres, coupled with a reduction on the previous year's reportable and non reportable incidents.

Whilst 100% of our electricity purchased is generated from renewable sources, wasting it is economically and environmentally unacceptable to us. The strategies to reduce energy usage throughout 2009 have also been linked to the property space we occupy as a business. We have improved the efficiency of our lighting, introduced further light / movement sensors, replaced additional light fittings with more efficient bulbs, focused on the efficiency and settings of our heating and cooling control systems as well as proactively managing the power requirements within our Data Centres. Our data centre power performance and reliability is increasing in importance year on year as our customers choose to order products online ­ in peak trading in 2009 online trading accounted up to 80% of our demand. Despite the year on year increase in the demands on these facilities we have successfully reduced our electricity consumption by 378'211 kWh ­ a reduction of 4.8% on the previous year. This equates to a C02 reduction of 206 tonnes across just 2 data centres.

· In 2008 we employed thermal imaging cameras to reduce heat build up in our IT servers. In 2009 we have continued to make these checks and have now utilised the same methodology to help improve our building thermal efficiency by locating areas of heat loss. To this end our team have recently been formally trained in Thermography.

a common sense measure on a large scale that has made a real impact on energy usage. alternative activity will take place in the warmer summer months to retain cool air and minimise solar gain and also take advantage of the cooler air throughout the night. as you may be able to see on the visible light image (above), on the left hand side window the blind is closed, this corresponds to the colder `blue' glass viewed in the thermal image (above right), showing clearly that heat is being retained by the closed blind, whereas the glass is warmer and heat is being lost from the other windows.

by controlling the opening and closing blinds within our buildings, we have effectively decreased the energy required to maintain a comfortable working environment. Opening the blinds increases solar gain during the early morning period - in cold periods this helps heat the building more quickly and efficiently. by closing all blinds at 6pm each evening throughout the Winter we have reduced heat loss overnight, minimising the amount of energy required to re-heat the building again in the morning prior to the working day beginning.

We have recently constructed an in house photo studio in our second head office building at the Skyways Campus. This part of the building has been fitted out with energy conservation in mind. We have created insulating pockets between many of the outer walls and the boundary walls. This has improved the aesthetic of this former storage facility for its new use as a studio but has also provided the additional benefit of insulating the walls, reducing heat loss. Entrances have had clear plastic curtain walls fitted to ensure heat loss is minimised, all main openings have a secondary door/s within the building to ensure the temperature remains static and heat loss is minimised.

The latest LED technology has been used to light the photo studio and new Reception. Each of the fittings uses just 11 watts of energy. The new 7500 sq ft studio is lit by just 19, 11 watt fittings, using 209 watts (the same as 3 and a half domestic 60w light bulbs!) ­ the space is enough to fit 10 average sized houses within it!

Instead of this waste going to landfill it is now processed into green energy using a Mechanical Heat Treatment process (MHT). This process converts non recyclable general waste into `green fuel' for use in specially adapted heat exchanging plants. The waste processed includes recyclables contaminated with food, oils and fats. We work closely with our Recycling partner to ensure all waste sent to the MHT plant is of the appropriate type.

Mechanical Heat Treatment (MHT) is a term that is used to describe a number of different processes that involve the mechanical (separation) and thermal (heat) treatment of waste. Following the introduction of this process at Shaw (our main distribution centre) our already excellent recycling figures have improved significantly ­ only 0.66% now goes to landfill. Prior to our adoption of the MHT process we had already been recognised for the existing levels of success in recycling.This action coupled with. reductions in our office printing volumes and new eco customer parcel sacks resulted in us being awarded Silver in the UK Recycling Stars awards.

business decisions that reduce environmental impact During 2009 a decision was taken to relocate the storage of clothing garments held on hangers from a 3rd party site into our main Distribution site. Not only will this improve the service we offer our customers, it will reduce overall transportation requirements we require via our 3rd party logistics firm Yodel. Next year we will report on the C02 reductions this change put in place by Shop Direct Group has provided. Once these products are relocated we will effectively reduce: · the number journeys driven by delivery vehicles from the former storage site and the Distribution centre bringing the products into one site will allow us to bring more types of items together into a single parcel. This `collating' will result in less orders being split into multiple deliveries to the customer ­ not only more convenient for the customer to receive everything at once, but we will only have to drive to their home address once rather than twice for this type of order. as a business this has a direct influence on our delivery and logistics provider by reducing their vehicle C02 emissions.

Even for the traditional English breakfasts we oven cook sausages, grill the bacon and now offer freshly cooked to order omelettes to offer an alternative to the fried egg!

2010 will bring a variety of challenges. We plan full group adoption of the british Standard 18001 for Health & Safety. We will be constructing a 5 year Carbon Reduction programme to align our activities with the Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme. Other 2010 Projects include; Voltage Optimisation / Group wide Transformer Tapping, new PC energy saving systems, installation of E-Cube devices making our refrigerators more efficient, a review of lighting control systems and building management systems (bMS) used in our Offices and Warehouses. We also intend to install ECO Max controllers to decrease energy usage. a bulb replacement programme will be costed out in an attempt to ensure all our lights are the most efficient type available. We also plan to make improvements to working environments at our sites. Within Heating and Cooling plant we will perform a full review of air conditioning efficiencies and align all our IT Server rooms to a defined operating criteria. Finally, in 2010 we plan to further influence our colleagues by taking our message out on awareness days at our sites, sharing with our colleagues some of the great activity that is carried out. The further challenge to this is to effectively influence our colleagues to actively promote energy efficiency in the products we sell to our customers. Influencing the mass market could be our greatest achievement to date. Practically this will involve ensuring energy ratings are more clearly displayed on our catalogue book pages and web pages and that we offer calculations of cost of energy per year when comparing items via our new web platform. "This a-rated item will cost approximately £100 per year to run (power and water cost) vs the b-rated Item at £150 per year" ­ this will encourage customers to `trade up' to the higher energy a-rated product as they can bear in mind the price and running costs as they may do for a new car for example.

This accounts for 90% of paper purchased by the Shop Direct Group. To further demonstrate the Group's commitment to sustainable forest management, by the end of 2010 all direct mail requirements will be produced using PEFC accredited paper. PEFC is the world's largest forest certification organisation, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, which promotes the independent third party certification of environmentallyappropriate, socially-beneficial and economicallyviable management of forests. as a responsible company, Shop Direct Group only purchases paper from paper suppliers that know the origin of all wood, have certified chain of custody, have been legally harvested and have not been sourced from conservation areas. Improved customer targeting has reduced the number of direct mail and catalogues sent to prospective customers. a total of 12 million books

[26,000 tonnes of paper] were sent to customers in 2009, a reduction of 3 million books against the 2008 forecast. Current forecasts for 2010 show that the number of books sent to customers increase by10% on 2009. However, the number of pages in 2010 will increase by 25% from the 2009 to provide a greater breath depth of products for our customers. a strategic imperative for the business in 2010 will be to transform customer insight into a competitive advantage. This will deliver a greater use of personalised online and paper customer communications to significantly improve response rates. Eliminating customer direct mail with poor response rates will have an environmental and cost benefit to the Shop Direct Group. all Shop Direct Group paper and print suppliers are ISO14001 accredited, an assurance that the production sites are committed to achieving continuous improvement through environmental management systems. also our print suppliers have continued to reduce their toluene solvent emission by investing in closed loop air recycling systems.

Working with qualitative research groups, we are able to gain reaction to both what we have produced and what we are planning ­ insight that has been invaluable in the re-positioning of the images that we create. Given the ethnic diversity of the UK population, we pro-actively seek to ensure that we have a range of models within our offers that reflect our customer base and have worked closely with our strategic model agencies to help deliver this across our women's, men's and childrenswear offers. Shop Direct has set clear standards and guidelines which define the characteristics of a healthy body image and have taken a strong ethical stance refusing to use `size zero' models.

"The policies and attitude toward the environment are above the required standards." "I think the report is fantastic; it has an outstanding layout and simple structure. I like way the company is considering its employees as part of CSR as opposed to simply pleasing external stakeholders. The strides the company is taking to improve its CSR is really promising, especially all of the investment in challenging economic times. I hope people take the time to read the report and that it gets the recognition it deserves from a wider audience. Let's hope we can grow and next year's will be even better!"
