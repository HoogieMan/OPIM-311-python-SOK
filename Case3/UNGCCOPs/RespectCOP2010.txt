Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Respect supports the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are aware of our responsibility to society and are committed to support and follow the universal declaration at all locations where we have activities. When we engage in partnership agreements, the partner should as well be committed to following human rights. Our contribution is also to help our customers to adjust their activities towards sustainable business that take the environment and humans under consideration. One way of doing this is by assisting customers to stalk out their sustainability strategy and to assess, prioritize and communicate their sustainability work based on the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines.
