In 2009 there was an adjustment of the Coating Additives purchase price. The owner company loan, meaning the loan from the Luxembourgbased Parent Company Financière Forêt S.à.r.l., is subordinated to the senior credits, second lien and mezzanine loans. These loans are considered as shareholders' equity in these key figures.

The Group was strongly affected by the financial crisis, primarily in the first quarter, notably in the form of lower volumes. Sales still rose by 3% during the year to SEK 12,542 m, on the back of acquisitions. On a comparable basis, volumes declined by 8% and total sales by 18%, due to falling commodity prices. A cost savings program and efficiency improvements were implemented, resulting in a 20% decrease in the work force and major cost savings. In addition, specific emphasis was made on maintaining the profit margin on Perstorp´s products. The operating profit before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) reached SEK 986 (1,670) m. Adjusted for items affecting comparison, EBITDA was SEK 1,100 (1,723) m. Most of the decline was due to lower volumes, together with price fall for the product TDI. A recovery began at the start of the second quarter and continued thereafter. Perstorp ends the year with a much stronger balance sheet thanks to shareholders' contributions. During the fourth quarter Perstorp reached an agreement with its banks, which improved the Group´s flexibility and included new financial covenants.

The effects of the global financial crisis were felt very strongly at the start of 2009. The immediate consequences were a fall in demand on nearly all markets combined with price cuts. The recovery in volumes started in the second quarter.

Market & economic conditions During 2009 all the players in the value chain worked with much shorter lead times ­ at times customers had just a few days' intermediates in stock ­ and pricing for many raw materials went from quarterly to monthly. In general, price fluctuations were very considerable in 2009. Lower demand, partly due to stock cutbacks in the customer chain, led in parallel to a loss of volume of around 25% during the first quarter. Starting in the second quarter volumes recovered gradually and for the year as a whole Perstorp's pro forma volume performance amounted to a fall of 8% compared with the previous year.

atic, mainly due to an overheated construction sector in countries such as Spain and Italy. In northern Europe we saw a steady recovery from the weak start to the year. Asia was hit hard in the first months of 2009 but the world's most dynamic market revived positively during the second half of the year. Turning to Perstorp's products, basic polyols experienced a tough start to the year, although volumes were recovered. The market for Penta remained challenging at the end of the year due to an unfavorable balance between supply and demand. For isocyanates ­ which is a significant product for Perstorp in terms of both sales and margins ­ the year was very difficult due to the plunge in prices for TDI. However, during the year the market trend has reversed. The crisis did not hit all products. Specialty polyols performed relatively well all year.

Formox had one of its best-ever years and continued to win market share from competing technologies. The Food & Feed business was completely unaffected. Potassium formate sold well as planned. The new plant was started up in the autumn of 2009, making Perstorp the largest producer of this product in the world. The caprolactones production site in Warrington, UK, is well equipped for further expansion. The new plant will open there in 2011. Currency effects boosted sales and margins but currency hedging had an overall negative effect of SEK 100 m on earnings.

Development by geographic region was highly varied in 2009. The US went into recession quickly, but its recovery began ahead of other regions. South America's resurgence was very swift. Southern Europe proved more problem-

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS | THE GROUP´S YEAR-END ACCOUNTS

Net sales & earnings
INCOME STATEMENT  Increased sales due to the acquisition of Coating Additives. For the Group as a whole, excluding the acquisition, volumes fell by 8% and prices by 17%. Currency effects were positive.  The savings program and improving efficiency led to oneoff costs and writedowns of around SEK 340 m in 2009.  Savings initiatives, including reduced costs for purchases other than raw materials, resulted in lower annual costs of around SEK 450 m.

Net sales Net sales climbed 3% during the year to reach SEK 12,542 m. Acquired businesses accounted for 21% of this increase, meaning that organic growth was negative at -18%.

mination shown in the cost-cutting program focused on purchases in addition to the major raw materials. Lay-offs and improved efficiency meant that around 550 people left the Group during the year, partly in connection with two of the Group's production units, in India and Chile, being mothballed. Costs were reduced this way by SEK 300 m. Earnings after depreciation and write-down for 2009 were affected by a total of around SEK 340 m in non-recurring items relating to these measures. Both the USD and EUR strengthened against the SEK, which benefitted both sales and margins, as the majority of the Group's operating cash flow is in these currencies. However, most of the flows for the year were hedged, which explains how the overall currency effect was negative by around SEK 100 m. Earnings for the acquired business in Coatings Additives for the year were much lower than expected. In the first quarter there was strong price pressure on TDI. During the second quarter the trend reversed and margins and earnings started to improve, which remained on a positive upwards course in the third quarter. However, production disruptions in the final quarter meant that earnings dipped down again temporarily as volumes and production efficiency fell. Operating earnings (EBIT) were SEK -270 m in 2009 (653). Write-downs totaled SEK 241 (241) m in the year relating to the Valex project. The project has taken on a new technical direction and scope, with scheduled product launch of DPHP during 2010 and with a plan for production of Valeraldehyde/ 2-PH. Plant values in Chile, India and China have also been impaired in connection with improved efficiency in production. Last year's impairment mainly relates to the plant in Singapore.

Depreciation rose compared with the previous year, from SEK 776 m to SEK 1,015 m, as a consequence of the acquired business and establishing its plants' market value and remaining life-lengths.
Net earnings Net financial items were SEK -1,019 m in 2009, compared with SEK -1,541 m for the period of comparison. There was a capital gain in 2009 relating to the Group's financing (309 m). Note 21 shows that financial currency differences were positive in 2009 but negative in the year of comparison. Comparable net financial items, excluding currency effects and capital gains, were SEK -1,394 m for 2009 and SEK -1,294 m the previous year. The acquisition of the Coating Additives business contributed to higher borrowings starting from September 2008 and higher interest costs as a result. In 2009 Perstorp's owner made a shareholder contribution of SEK 1.6 billion, most of which was contributed at the end of the year, and also converted SEK 372 m from a shareholder loan into shareholders' equity. This had a favorable effect on net financial items.

Volumes fell by 8%, mainly in the first quarter when the downturn was 25%, not least due to decreasing stock at customers. During the remainder of the year volumes recovered gradually. Production disruptions at Perstorp's operation in France, and at one of the Stenungsund plant's suppliers, impacted negatively on volumes in the fourth quarter. Sale prices fell by 17% over the year, mainly due to falling raw material prices. The Swedish krona weakened against the USD and EUR, which meant sales were 7% higher when converted into SEK.
Earnings Operating earnings before depreciation and amortization reached SEK 986 m in 2009, compared with SEK 1,670 m in 2008. If items affecting comparison are excluded, operating earnings were SEK 1,100 m compared with SEK 1,723 in 2008. Earnings for the period were also affected negatively by around SEK 80 m by the significant falls in raw material prices at the end of 2008, which meant that inventories were written down to the net realizable value and these products therefore had a margin of zero when sold at the start of the year. Items affecting comparison primarily comprise rationalization measures, and the figure for 2008 included a capital gain of SEK 116 m for the sale of a business.

The net loss for the year was SEK 784 (loss 627) m.
Currency effects on earnings The Group has considerable cash flows, earnings and assets in foreign currencies, primarily EUR and USD. A large proportion of sales, 65%, are made in Europe, with just 10% in Sweden. Virtually all invoicing is in EUR and USD, which is also true for purchases of raw materials. However, a large part of costs are in SEK, since one third of the Group's employees work in Sweden.

The lower comparable earnings figure is principally due in full to the fall in volumes. The Group managed to maintain profit margins on prices, despite great turbulence on the raw materials front. An important factor here was the deter-

Operating profit is thus exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between SEK and USD/EUR. When SEK strengthens by 1% against EUR, the Group's EBITDA falls by SEK 22 m. For USD

6

the corresponding figure is SEK 8 m. Predicted transaction and consolidation exposure was not hedged at the end of 2009. Instead the Group handles part of its exposure by borrowing in USD and EUR. This partly reduces inward flows of USD and EUR due to interest payments and partly means that exposure for one of the bank key figures ­ net debt in relation to EBITDA ­ is reduced.
Interest sensitivity As mentioned above, the Group borrows in USD and EUR to reduce currency exposure for net debt in relation to earnings, which also spreads interest risk, as interest rates are different in other currencies. Part of the loans are in SEK.

period was 240 days. Interest rate hedging radically reduces interest rate risk, to a total of SEK -35 m annually for a one percent rise in interest, from a level of SEK -116 m if no hedging had been performed.
Pro forma quarterly earnings To provide a more complete picture of the current Group's sales and earnings trend, net sales and EBITDA are presented below pro forma. The activities that have been acquired during the period have been included as if they were part of the Group throughout 2008. Historic figures are based on unaudited data from the sellers.

a large part due to a price fall at the end of 2008. Prices began to rise again in the second quarter. Positive currency effects of 9% compensated for part of this fall in prices. Comparable earnings before and after impairment fell from SEK 2,340 m in 2008 to SEK 1,100 m in 2009. As explained above the Group excluding acquired business was hit by a decline in volumes that impacted hard on the Group's profitability. For the acquired Coating Additives business area, the first three quarters were very strong. The business was then hit hard by the financial crisis, which was expressed in the form of a sudden fall in prices combined with inventory cutbacks in all levels. A recovery was noted from April 2009, and since then margins and volumes have climbed steadily upwards. The start of the fourth quarter was affected by disruptions to production.

Interest rate hedging is used to establish fixed interest for a bit more than half of all bank loans, in accordance with the Group's finance policy. At the end of 2009 the average fixed rate

Pro forma sales fell in 2009 by 18% compared with the previous year, of which half represents a fall in volumes. Prices also fell by 18%, of which TDI, a product manufactured by the Coating Additives business area, accounted for

Financial position

BALANCE SHEET  Dramatic reinforcement of balance sheet through shareholders' contribution of close to SEK 1.6 billion.  Renegotiated loan agreement including the bank's new key indicators during the remaining period of the loan.  Continued focus on capital optimization and minimal credit losses during the global economic downturn.

Net debt excluding the owner's loan fell during the year by almost SEK 2 billion. This was made possible through a shareholders' equity contribution of around SEK 1.6 billion. Some mezzanine receivables were bought back, reducing the debt by a further SEK 300 m. Favorable currency effects amounted to around SEK 500 m. Working capital fell during the year by around SEK 300 m, and the turnover rate improved additionally. Cash flow after investments was however negative and therefore increased liabilities somewhat. An agreement was reached in the fourth quarter with a number of banks concerning the renegotiation of the loan agreement. This included

new bank coverants. The Group's principal financing comprises senior credits pledged by Svenska Handelsbanken, Nordea, DnB NOR and HSH Nordbank as well as second lien and mezzanine facilities syndicated to around 20 financing institutions in 2006.
Currency effects on balance sheet All items in the balance sheet were affected by the growing strength of the SEK during 2009. The SEK-EUR moved from 10.94 to 10.35 and the SEK-USD from 7.75 to 7.21. Large parts of the Group's assets and liabilities are denominated in these two currencies. Of the operating capital around half is in EUR, and large parts are in SEK, USD and GBP.

The distribution of loans in different currencies is presented on the previous page in the section entitled `Interest sensitivity'. Around 40% of the loans, in addition to the loans from the owners, are in EUR, while 30% each are in USD and SEK. Overall at the end of the year the Group's currency exposure was therefore larger concerning earnings than for borrowings, which means that a general weakening of SEK is favorable for the relation between net debt and EBITDA.

Cash flow
Cash flow from operations was SEK 260 (604) m in 2009. An optimization of working capital, mainly in the form of reduced stock levels and less overdue accounts receivable are behind the positive cash flow. Interest payments and tax were at around the same level as operating earnings before depreciation. Investments in fixed assets were SEK 582 (590) m. The major investment projects during the year were for the expansion of caprolactones capacity in the UK, new boilers for the Stenungsund plant and the completion of the potassium formate plant in Perstorp, as well as a large number of maintenance investments within Coating Additives, and also the implementation of the SAP business system for this business. On the financing front, the Parent Company made a major shareholders' contribution, which significantly improved the Group's flexibility. The Group reduced its dependency on bank credit, of which amortization makes up around SEK 1 billion according to plan. Available capacity, including liquid funds and unused letter of credit facilities, amounted to SEK 1,224 m at year-end.

New organization During the year significant changes were made to Perstorp's organization. Greater decision-making powers were given to the business areas to help them be more reactive to market changes and meet the customers needs. Changes to the senior executive team enabled sufficient focus to be directed externally while also supporting the execution of key internal measures.

around 2,200. This is partly due to overmanning created by re-organization and partly because production at El Salto, Chile, and Vapi, India, has been put in mothballs. Furthermore, Perstorp has sold a production site for Neo in Yongliu, China, with the aim of starting Neo production at Zibo instead.
The environment The Group has production in eleven countries. Most of the Group's activities in Sweden require permits. Activities requiring permits primarily involve polyalcohols, formalin, formic acid and other acids and alcohols. Each unit submits an annual environment report to be approved by the inspection authority. In other countries Perstorp follows national and local requirements. Key events after the end of the financial year After the end of the year, Perstorp France acquired shares in Exeltium, representing a holding of around 4%. Exeltium is a consortium of 28 electricity-intensive companies, thus ensuring direct access to power. The company in turn buys energy from EDF, through long-term contracts. Perstorp France is hereby ensured between 21 and 30 MW annually for the production facilities at Pont-de-Claix.

At the Annual General Meeting in May Lennart Holm left the position of Chairman of the Board. President and CEO Bo Dankis was elected as Lennart Holm's successor. Lennart Holm will remain as Vice Chairman. Martin Lundin was appointed deputy CEO with extensive operational responsibility. In September Martin Lundin took over the position of CEO. Claes Gard left the post of Chief Financial Officer, at his own request, at the start of 2009. He will however continue his engagement in Perstorp, as member of the Board. The new CFO is Johan Malmqvist who joins Perstorp from Duni AB. The Group also has a new Executive Vice President Human Resources & Communication, Mikael Gedin, who joins the company from ABB. Lennart Hagelqvist was appointed head of Coating Additives, and Anders Lundin was made head of Performance Products. Mats Persson remains as head of Specialty Intermediates and in September he was appointed deputy CEO. Martin White has been appointed head of a new unit ­ Region Asia ­ which was formed in July to better follow development in this exciting growth region.
Employees The number of employees in the Group has fallen by around 20% to

During the first quarter 2010, the decision was taken to convert loans from Parent Company Financière Forêt S.à.r.l., amounting to SEK 1 billion, to shareholder´s equity. The conversion is expected to take place in the second quarter 2010.

GENERAL INFORMATION
 IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures". The change involves a requirement for extended disclosure of the valuation of financial instruments at fair value and how the liquidity risk concerning financial instruments should be handled in practice. Since this change is only related to disclosures it does not affect reporting of consolidated earnings and position.  IFRS 8 "Operating Segments". This new standard ­ which replaces IAS 14 ­ is based on segment reporting from an internal management perspective. The consequence is that information shall be provided per segment as the ultimate decision-maker continually views activities. The standard is related to disclosures and does not affect reporting of consolidated earnings and position. The Group has chosen not to apply this standard as it is not a legal requirement, see Note 5. For standards, changes and interpretations of existing standards not yet in effect, see chapter 2.15. The Group has decided not to apply any of these changes in advance. Parent Company The Parent Company's financial reports are produced in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and recommendations from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board concerning Reporting for legal entities (RFR 2.2). The starting point for RFR 2.2 is that the Parent Company shall implement all of the EU-approved standards and interpretations as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish law safeguarding pension commitments and with consideration for the relationship between accounting and taxation. The main differences between the Group's and Parent Company's accounting principles are as follows: Subsidiaries Shares in subsidiaries are reported at the time of acquisition at acquisition value/fair value. This value remains until impairment is carried out. Impairment tests of reported balance sheet values are carried out in accordance with chapter 2.10. Starting from 2009, dividends from subsidiaries are reported fully in the income statements. Previously income was reported in the income statement to the extent that profit was earned after the date of acquisition. Dividends in excess of this profit were considered as a repayment of investment and was thereby settled against the reported value of the participation. Group contribution & shareholders' contribution In accordance with the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (UFR2 ­ Group contributions and shareholder contributions), the Parent Company reports received Group contributions from subsidiaries as dividends and reports them in the income statement. Shareholder contributions are reported directly under the shareholders' equity of the receiver and are capitalized under the "Group company holdings" of the provider to the extent that impairment is not required. Financial instruments The Parent Company does not report financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39. Financial instruments are used by the company to hedge interest rate risks and are held until the maturity date. Against this background, interest rate swap contracts, forward contracts and currency swaps are not reported at fair value in the Parent Company's balance sheet and income statement. Pensions The Parent Company reports pension commitments in accordance with the Swedish law safeguarding pension commitments. Adjustments are made to the accounts at Group level in accordance with IFRS/IAS19. Leasing For the Parent Company, all leasing agreements are reported according to the rules for operational leasing.

Perstorp Holding AB and its subsidiaries (jointly designated the Group) produce and sell specialty chemicals. At the end of the report period the Group had 13 (14) manufacturing units in 11 (12) countries in Europe, North America and Asia. These geographic areas comprise the Group's main markets for sales, with the main focus in Europe. The Group was formed at the end of 2005 when a private equity company, PAI partners became the owner through Perstorp Holding AB. Since this time PAI partners has controlled the Group through Luxembourg-based Financière Forêt S.à.r.l., corp. reg. no. R.C.S. Luxembourg: B 111 888, which owns 100% of Perstorp Holding AB. The acquisition balance sheet for the Group was completed as of 2006. The Parent Company is a limited liability company that is registered and has its Head Office in Perstorp, Sweden. The address to the head office is 284 80 Perstorp, Sweden. The Board approved this report for publication on 21 April 2010.

note 2

SUMMARY OF MAJOR ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The principal accounting principles applied in the preparation of these consolidated accounts are stated below. The principles are unchanged compared with all years of comparison unless otherwise stated.

2.1 Basis for preparing the accounts
Group The consolidated accounts for Perstorp Holding AB have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board's recommendation concerning Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups (RFR 1.2) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IDRIC interpretations as approved by the European Commission. (IFRS has been applied by the Group since 2005.) The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the acquisition value method, apart from matters applying to financial assets held for sale and financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are fair valued via the income statement. Preparing financial reports in accordance with IFRS requires the use of a number of important accounting estimates. In addition, management must make certain judgments when applying the company's accounting principles. The areas subject to a high degree of judgment and that are complex, or those areas in which assumptions or estimates have been made that are of material importance to the consolidated accounts, are presented in Note 4. Standards (IAS/IFRS), changes and interpretations (IFRIC) now in effect that are applicable for the 2009 financial year and are applied by the Group:  IAS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements" has been revised. The changed standard requires that only owner-related transactions concerning equity shall be included in the report of the Group's change in shareholders' equity. All other transactions concerning change in equity (income and expense items) shall be reported separately and be included as a part of the Group report on comprehensive income. Comprehensive income can either be presented in a single table, based on previous, traditional profit/loss statements, or two statements can be presented ­ an income statement and a report of comprehensive income. Perstorp has chosen the latter. Comparable information has been restated, so that it agrees with the revised standard. The adjustments made for compared years do not affect the outcome as a whole, just the presentation format.  IAS 23 "Borrowing Costs". The standard has changed with regard to borrowing costs directly attributable to purchases, construction or production of an asset that takes a significant time to complete for use or sale. Previously, a choice could be made and the Group followed the principle of consistently reporting borrowing costs directly. The Group now capitalizes borrowing costs for projects with a start date of 1 January 2009. The change in accounting principles is a consequence of applying transition rules in IAS 23 and comparable data has therefore been recalculated. No specific large projects were started in 2009, which is why there are no capitalized borrowing costs for 2009 concerning investment in fixed assets.  IFRS 1 "Firsttime Application of IFRS" and IAS 27 "Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements". For Perstorp the change means that all dividends from subsidiaries, joint ventures or associated companies shall be reported as income, even to the extent that the dividend relates to reserves established prior to the date of acquisition. Previously, a received dividend established prior to acquisition was deducted from the acquisition value of the asset.

2.2 Consolidated accounting
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all companies in which the Group has the right to devise financial and operating strategies in a manner normally associated with a shareholding amounting to more than half of voting rights. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date on which the Group gains this decisive influence. Subsidiaries are excluded from the consolidated accounts from the date on which the decisive influence ceases. All subsidiaries are reported and consolidated using the purchase accounting method. The cost of an acquisition comprises the fair value of assets transferred in payment and liabilities arising or assumed on the date of transfer, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Acquired identifiable assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities from an acquisition are initially valued at the fair value on the date of acquisition, regardless of the extent of any minority interest. The surplus, which

19

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS | NOTES

consists of the difference between the acquisition value and the fair value of the Group's share of identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is reported as goodwill. If the acquisition cost is less than the fair value of the acquired subsidiary's net assets, the difference is reported directly in the income statement. All intra-Group transactions, balance sheet items and unrealized gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the consolidated accounts. The accounting principles for subsidiaries have been changed, where necessary to guarantee the consistent and appropriate application of Group principles. Associated companies Associated companies are companies over which the Group exercises a controlling influence, which generally applies to shareholdings corresponding to 20 to 50% of the voting rights. Holdings in associated companies are accounted for using the equity method and are initially valued at acquisition value, including any goodwill identified on acquisition. The Group's share of associated company earnings arising after acquisition is reported after tax in the Group's operating earnings. Classification in the income statement is the consequence of the company conducting operations in line with the rest of the Group. Accumulated changes following the acquisition are reported as changes in the book value of the holding. When the Group's share of an associated company's losses amounts to or exceeds its holding in the associated company, including any unsecured receivables, the Group does not report further losses unless it has assumed obligations or made payments on behalf of the associated company. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its associated companies are eliminated in relation to the Group's holding in the associated company. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction is evidence of there being an impairment requirement for the transferred asset. The accounting principles for associated companies have been changed in places to guarantee the consistent and appropriate application of Group principles. Joint ventures Joint ventures refer to a relationship founded on an agreement in which two or more partners operate an economic activity together and have a joint deciding influence over the activity. Holdings in joint ventures are reported using the equity method, as with holdings in associated companies. Classification of profit shares are also reported in the same way as with associated companies as a result of business focus. Accounting principles for joint ventures have been changed in places to guarantee the consistent and appropriate application of Group principles. Minority shares The share of net assets belonging to the minority interest is reported as a separate item in consolidated shareholders' equity. In the consolidated income statement the minority share is included in reported earnings. Transactions with minority parties are reported in the same way as with third parties. Divestment of minority shares results in profit or loss which is reported in the income statement. Acquisition of minority shares may create goodwill if the acquisition value exceeds the value of the acquired net assets.

rency). In the consolidated accounts these amounts are then translated into the Group's reporting currency (SEK) in accordance with the following:  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet are translated at the exchange rate applying on the balance-sheet date  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for each year, and  all exchange-rate differences that arise are reported as a separate item in consolidated shareholders' equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange-rate differences arising as a consequence of the translation of net investments in foreign operations, borrowing and other currency instruments identified as hedges for such investments are allocated to shareholders' equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. On the divestment of foreign operations, accumulated exchange-rate differences in the income statement are reported under shareholders' equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the capital gain/loss. Goodwill and adjustments of fair value arising from the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities associated with such operations and are translated at the exchange rate applying on the balance-sheet date.

2.4 Revenue recognition
Reported revenue is the fair value of what has been received or will be received for sold goods and services within the Group's ongoing business with deductions for VAT, discounts, returns and eliminations of intragroup transactions. Revenue per category is reported as follows: Sales of goods Revenues from the sales of goods are reported upon delivery to the customer in accordance with sales terms and thereby in the period when all significant risks and benefits attributable to the goods are transferred to the purchaser in accordance with an agreement. Sales of services & contractor assignment Sales revenues and earnings from sales of formalin plants are reported in accordance with IAS 11, Construction Contracts, which means that income and costs are recognized in line with the completion of an assignment on the balance sheet date. In cases where it is probable that the total cost of the assignment will exceed the total contract income, the surplus amount is reported immediately as a cost. The degree of completion is established on the basis of the assignment costs incurred on the balance sheet date as a percentage of the estimated total assignment costs for each individual assignment. Costs incurred during the year that pertain to future work are not included in assignment costs incurred when establishing the degree of completion. These are reported as inventories. Interest income Interest income is recognized as revenue distributed over the contract term using the effective interest method. Received dividends Dividends are reported as revenue when the right to receive the dividend is judged to be certain.

2.3 Currency translation
Functional currency & reporting currency Items included in the financial reports of the various Group units are valued in the currency used in the economic environment in which each company mainly operates (functional currency). In the consolidated accounts, SEK is used, which is the Parent Company's functional currency and the Group's reporting currency. Transactions & balance sheet items Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency according to the exchange rates applicable on the transaction date or the date when the items are re-assessed. Exchange-rate gains and losses arising through the payment of such transactions and on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at the exchange rate applicable on the closing date are reported in the income statement under "Other income and expenses" when the underlying receivable/liability is operational; otherwise in net financial items. The exception is where transactions represent hedges meeting the requirements for hedge accounting of cash flows or net investments, where gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Group companies The earnings and financial position of all Group companies are established in each company's functional currency (none of which is classified as a high-inflation cur-

2.5 Income taxes
Reported income taxes in the income statement include current tax, adjustment of prior-year current tax and changes in deferred tax. Tax is reported directly in shareholders' equity if the tax is attributable to transactions which are reported directly in shareholders' equity. Calculation of income tax and assessment of all current and deferred tax liabilities and receivables are made in accordance with each Group company's national tax regulations and tax rates that have been decided or that with a great degree of certainty will be determined and apply when the tax is to be paid. It can be added that the Group management team regularly assesses claims made in tax assessments concerning situations where applicable tax rules are subject to interpretation. When interpretations change and when it is considered to be appropriate, allocations are adjusted to the amount that will probably be paid to the tax authority. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the balance sheet method on the basis of all material temporary differences between the book values and taxable values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets pertaining to unutilized tax loss carryforwards are only reported when it is likely that it will be possible to realize the loss carryforwards within the foreseeable future.

20

Deferred tax assets/liabilities are offset when there is a legal right to offset the asset or liability in question and when deferred tax assets/liabilities relate to taxes debited by the same tax authority. In this context there shall also be an intention to settle the item through a new payment.

2.7 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are reported at their acquisition value less accumulated depreciation according to plan and in certain cases less impairment. The acquisition value includes expenses that can be directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset. From 2009 this also includes borrowing costs attributable to acquisitions of fixed assets that take a significant amount of time to complete for use (these were previously charged directly). Additional expenses are added to the asset's reported value or reported as a separate asset, depending on which is appropriate, but only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset accrue to the Group and the asset's acquisition value can be measured reliably. Reported value for replaced parts is deducted from capitalized value. All other forms of expenses for repairs and maintenance are reported as costs in the income statement during the period they arise. Straight-line depreciation is applied based on the asset's acquisition value and estimated useful life. When the assets' depreciable amount is established the residual value of the asset is also considered as appropriate. The following depreciation periods are used: Buildings Land improvements Machinery and equipment Computers, tools and cars 20-50 years 10-35 years 10-30 years max. 5 years

2.6 Intangible assets
Goodwill comprises the amount by which the acquisition value exceeds the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on the acquisition of Group companies is reported as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested annually in order to identify impairment requirements. When conducting tests to identify possible impairment requirements, goodwill is divided among cash-generating units and each unit is tested individually. The reported value of goodwill comprises therefore the acquisition value less accumulated impairments. Impairment of goodwill is not recovered. Trademarks, patents and licenses that apply to separately acquired assets from external parties are reported initially at acquisition value. Trademarks, patents and licences acquired through acquisition of a business are reported initially at their fair value on the day of acquisition. Trademarks, patents and licences that have a determinable period of utilisation are assessed individually and depreciated linearly based on this, normally over 5-30 years. Assets with unlimited utilisation periods are not normally subject to depreciation. For the Group, assets with an indeterminate lifelength within this category refer to the Perstorp and Formox trademarks, which in connection with the allocation of acquisition values in 2006, were judged to have an unlimited life, based on the company's 125 year history and the continuous renewal process. Annual testing of possible impairment requirements is performed for assets in this category. Technological knowhow was identified as a balance sheet item in connection with the allocation of acquisition values in 2006 and its acquisition value has linear depreciation to divide the costs over the assessed utilisation period of 30 years. At the acquisition of Coating Additives in 2008, part of the value was identified as being technological know-how. This is depreciated over 15 years. Testing of possible impairment requirements is performed annually. Customer relations: In connection with the allocation of acquisition values in 2006, a value was identified that reflects the future value generation related to core customers. A value for intangible assets was established relating to customer relations in connection with the acquisition of the UK business in 2008. The acquisition value has linear depreciation in order to divide the cost over the lifespan of the relations which is expected to be 30 years and 10 years respectively. Annual testing of impairment requirements is performed through the analysis of future value generation in respect of sales to core customers, adjusted for the values already recognized in the form of trademarks and technological know-how. Research costs are expensed directly when they arise, while expenses relating to the development of new products/processes are capitalized as intangible assets if they fulfill the following criteria: the expenses must be identifiable in a reliable way, the management team intends to complete production of the asset and use/sell it, there must be external preconditions for using/selling the asset, and it must be highly probable that the asset will generate future financial benefits. Unless all criteria are met, the cost is reported directly. Costs that have previously been expensed may not subsequently be reported as assets. The amortization of capitalized development costs is linear and starts when the product starts to be produced commercially or the process starts to be used for commercial production. The amortization period must not exceed five years. Tests are performed annually to see if there is an impairment requirement. Software: Acquired software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs that have arisen for acquiring and deploying the software. Costs for the development and maintenance of software are normally expensed when they arise. If the particular software is unique, controlled by the Group and will probably generate economic benefits that exceed the costs for more than one year, the software is reported as an intangible asset. Personnel expenses for software development and a reasonable portion of attributable indirect costs are included. Costs for capitalized software licences and software development are amortized over their estimated useful life, which may not exceed three years. All capitalized assets in this category are subject to an annual test concerning utilization period and impairment requirement.

Land and construction in progress are not depreciated. Interest on capital borrowed to finance investments in assets is not included in the acquisition value. The residual value and useful life of assets are impairment tested regularly or when external or internal circumstances dictate such impairment testing, and are adjusted as necessary. An asset's book value is immediately impaired to its recoverable amount if the asset's book value exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. See chapter 2.10. Gains and losses on divestment are determined by comparing the sales proceeds and the book value and are reported in the income statement under the heading Other operating income and expenses.

2.8 Leasing
The Group is party to leasing agreements whereby the Group as leaseholder to all extents and purposes profits from the economic benefits relating to the leased object while also bearing the economic risks. These agreements are recognized as financial leasing. At the start of the leasing period the leasing object is reported as a fixed asset in the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value and the current value of the contracted minimum leasing fees. On the liability side, the estimated value of the commitment is offset against future cash flow based upon the leasing agreement. A division is made between short-term and long-term borrowing depending on the due date for payment. Upon settlement the paid sum is divided between amortization of debt and the financial costs. The interest part of the financial cost is reported in the income statement over the leasing period, so that each period includes an amount that corresponds to a fixed interest rate for the reported debt during the period. Capitalized fixed assets in financial leasing agreements are depreciated according to the same principles used for other assets. Some of the Group's leasing contracts pertain to vehicles and computers, which have been reported as operational leasing. In addition, there is operational leasing of, among other items, pipelines and storage facilities at the unit in Singapore. Payments made during the leasing period are carried in the income statement linearly over the leasing period.

2.9 Financial instruments
In its balance sheets, the Group reports financial instruments that comprise loans, other financial receivables, accounts receivable, liquid funds, borrowings, accounts payable and derivatives. Instruments are included in the accounts at the time when the Group becomes a party to them in accordance with contracted terms. In the same way the instrument is removed when the asset and its benefits/risks are no longer attributable to the Group, nor controlled by it, or when an undertaking is completed or ended in any other way. Assessment is initially made at fair value and thereafter at fair value or accrued acquisition value depending on the classification of the instrument. An assessment of the need for impairment is made frequently, see 2.10. Financial instruments are offset and reported at net value in the balance sheets only when there is a legal right to offset between the amounts and there is an intention to settle the amounts with a net sum, or alternatively to realize the asset and settle the liability at the same time.

21

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS | NOTES

Financial instruments assessed at fair value via the income statement This category includes financial assets/liabilities held for trading plus derivative instruments not identified as hedge instruments. Assessment at fair value via the income statement occurs at both the time of acquisition and at regular assessments thereafter. Loans & accounts receivable Loans and accounts receivable are reported initially at fair value. Thereafter, loans are reported at accrued acquisition value using the effective interest method. Accounts receivable are normally reported at their original fair value when the effect of discounting is considered to be marginal. When an assessment is made by the Group that a receivable will not be paid, and there is objective evidence for this, a reservation is made. See further under point 2.10. Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances and other short-term investments maturing within three months and that can easily be converted into cash. Borrowings Borrowings are reported initially at fair value, net after transaction costs. Other borrowing expenses are also reported in the income statement based on the period to which they relate including borrowing costs attributed over a period. For classification reasons, borrowings are reported as short-term liabilities to the extent that the Group does not have a unconditional right to defer payment of the liabilities for at least 12 months after the closing date. Other borrowings are reported analogously as long-term liabilities. Accounts payable Accounts payable are undertakings to pay for goods/services acquired in the ongoing business and are reported at fair value.

among contingent liabilities for this category of pension. Defined-benefit pension plans are not determined by contributions; they are instead a commitment for the Group and are thus balanced as a provision. The commitment comprises an amount for the pension benefit an employee shall receive upon retirement, which is assessed with reference to age, years of service, future salary increase and inflation. The pension plans are normally financed through payments to insurance companies or funds managed by asset managers in accordance with periodical actuarial calculations. In connection with the allocation 2006 of acquisition value, actuarial gains and losses were set at zero, as a result of the opening liability being established at the present value of the obligation at the date of transition and, similarly, any related plan assets have been fair valued. Actuarial calculations of defined-benefit pension plans are performed at the end of each year. Pension costs pertaining to these plans are calculated in accordance with the Projected Unit Credit Method, which allocates costs over the employees' anticipated working life. Actuarial gains and losses outside what is known as the 10% corridor are allocated over the remaining anticipated term of employment for those employees who are part of the various plans. With the help of a discount rate, pension commitments are valued at the present value of the future anticipated payments. The discount rate corresponds to the interest on first-class corporate bonds or treasury bills with a remaining term that corresponds to the commitments concerned. The liability that arises is adjusted for reported actuarial profit and loss, and for unreported costs for service in previous years. In the consolidated balance sheet, the pension commitments for the fund plans are reported net, after a deduction for the fund assets for the plan. In cases where a net asset arises, this is reported as a financial interest-bearing receivable, although this has not occurred in the past two years. Instead the entire commitment is carried as a liability and included in the calculation of net debt. The Group's payments for defined-contribution pension plans are reported as a staff cost during the period when the employee performed the services to which the contributions pertain. For defined-contribution plans, the interest effect and return on plan assets attributable to the plan are reported in net financial items, while other costs are included in operating profit. Remuneration for redundancy Remuneration is paid for redundancy when an employee's employment is terminated before normal retirement or when the employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for remuneration. The Group reports severance pay when a formal plan is presented or an offer is made and an obligation or legal undertaking is created. Other remuneration & bonus plans Other short-term remuneration to employee is reported as a cost when an employee has performed a service in exchange for remuneration. Reservations for bonuses are reported continually as a liability and cost in accordance with predicted outcome and the economic impact of the agreement.

2.10 Impairment
Tangible and intangible assets with an indeterminate useful life are not depreciated/ amortized but are subject to annual testing of impairment requirements. Tangible and intangible assets with a determined useful life are assessed for a reduction in value whenever events or changes in conditions indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized in the amount by which the asset's or cashgenerating unit's book value exceeds its recoverable value, which in the current situation means the higher of the utilisation value or fair value with deductions for sales costs. In connection with the test an assessment is made as to whether there has been a change in the recovered value for an individual asset/cash-generating unit and if the previous impairment can be recovered fully or partly. Impairment is never recovered for goodwill. A test for an impairment requirement is performed for financial assets at the end of the report period. Impairment is performed as soon as there is objective evidence that events have taken place which indicate that estimated future cash flows from an asset will be lower than the reported balance sheet total. The impairment amount is calculated as the difference between the asset's reported value and assessed future cash flow (current value is calculated for instruments classified as fixed assets). If there are observable market prices for the instrument, the impairment calculation is based on this fair value. In connection with the test an assessment is also made if events have occurred, and objective evidence is available, which mean that a previously carried out impairment shall be returned fully or partly.

2.13 Provisions
Provisions are reported when the Group has an existing legal or informal obligation as a result of the occurrence of an event for which it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and for which the amount can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for restructuring are primarily reported for severance pay and other costs affecting cash flow that arise in connection with restructuring of the Group's activities.

2.11 Inventories
Inventories are reported on the closing date at the lower of acquisition value and net realizable value. The acquisition value is determined using a method mainly based on weighted average prices. The acquisition value of finished products and work in progress consists of raw materials, direct payroll expenses, other direct costs and attributable indirect manufacturing costs (based on normal manufacturing capacity). Borrowing costs are not included; there are no inventories for which IAS 23 is applicable. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price based on continuing operations, less applicable variable selling costs.

2.14 Derivative financial instruments & hedge measures
Derivative instruments are reported in the balance sheet on the contract date and are assessed at fair value, both initially and upon ensuing assessments. The method for reporting the profit and loss that arises at re-assessment depends on whether the derivative is identified as a hedge instrument, and ­ if such is the case ­ the character of the hedge item. The Group uses the following hedge instruments: - Cash flow hedges in the form of interest swaps, currency forward contracts and electricity forward contracts, in order to hedge interest rates, currencies and electricity prices. For further details see section 3, Risk Management. - Equity hedge ­ loans in foreign currency, for hedging of net investments. When the transactions take place, the Group documents the relationship between the hedge instrument and the hedged item, as well as the Group's targets for risk management and the strategy for the hedge. The Group also documents its assessment of the efficiency of the hedge instrument, both when entering the hedge and continually during the duration of the hedge. Changes in the hedge reserve in shareholders' equity are presented in the equity table. All of the fair value of the derivative

2.12 Employee benefits
Pensions The Group has both defined-contribution and defined-benefit pension plans. The characteristic of a defined-contribution pension plan is that the Group pays a fixed contribution to a separate legal entity. After the premium is paid the Group has no legal or informal obligations to pay additional fees if the counter party does not have sufficient assets to pay benefits to employee relating to the employee's service in earlier years. There are therefore no provisions in the consolidated balance sheet or

22

used as the hedge instrument is classified as a fixed asset or long-term liability when the hedged item's remaining maturity is greater than 12 months, and as a current asset or short-term liability when the hedged item's remaining maturity is less than 12 months. Cash flow hedging The effective part of the change in fair value of a derivative instrument that is identified as cash flow hedging and that meets the conditions for hedge accounting, is reported in comprehensive income. At the end of the year this effect amounted to SEK -110 (-230) m with a maturity within 12 months. This amount is divided between SEK -108 (-126) m in interest swaps, SEK -1 (-13) m in electricity forward contracts and SEK -1 (-91) m in currency hedges. The profit or loss attributable to the ineffective part is reported immediately in the income statement. Accumulated amounts in shareholders' equity are returned to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects earnings (e.g. when the forecast event that is hedged takes place). The profit or loss attributable to the effective part of the interest swap that hedges loans with variable interest is reported in net financial items in the income statement. When a hedge instrument falls due, is sold or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting and accumulated profits or losses relating to the hedge are in equity, the profits/losses remain in equity and are capitalized at the same time that the forecast transactions are finally reported in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated profit or loss reported in equity is transferred immediately to the income statement. Hedging of net investments Hedging of net investments in foreign businesses is reported in a similar way to cash flow hedging. The share of profit or loss in a hedge instrument assessed as an efficient hedge is reported in other comprehensive income. The profit or loss attributable to the ineffective part is reported immediately in the income statement. The part of the Group's borrowings in foreign currency identified for hedge accounting amounts to EUR 295 (295) m. The currency results for translating these sums amounted to SEK 190 (326) m at the end of 2009. Derivates assessed at fair value via the income statement; currency swaps Changes in fair value for currency swaps are reported immediately in net financial items in the income statement. The primary purpose of currency swap contracts is to hedge the treasury's currency risk exposure in different currencies. The contracts have therefore been classified in different portfolios depending on which category of currency exposure will be hedged. In general, the categories cover the treasury's intra-Group borrowings and loans in different currencies with determined maturities as well as the daily borrowings and loans in currency accounts at various banks. The maturities vary, up to three months. Currency accounts are hedged with one-month maturities.

2.15 Effects of future accounting principles
Standard (IAS/IFRS), changes and interpretations (IFRIC) coming into effect after 2009 and supported by the EU: When the consolidated financial statements of December 31, 2009 were being compiled, the following standards, changes and interpretations had been announced and will be compulsory for groups whose financial year starts on 1 January 2010 or later. None of them have been implemented in advance.  IAS 32 "Financial instruments: Classification" (applicable from February 1, 2010). This change is aimed at classification of subscription rights and reporting in the event that the instruments are issued in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer. The change is not relevant for the group as of the closing date of 2009.  IAS 27 "Consolidated and separate financial statements" (applicable from July 1, 2009). The change means that all transactions involving shareholders, including shareholders without any decisive influence, are reported under shareholders' equity on condition that the transaction does not change the decisive influence and no longer gives rise to goodwill or profit/loss. In the event of partial sale where the decisive influence ends, the remaining owned part is re-assessed to fair value at the time the decisive influence ends according to agreement. The re-assessment impacts in full on the income statement. Formerly owned participations are also re-assessed at fair value in the income statement at later acquisitions. This change comes into force on January 1, 2010.  IFRS 3 "Business combinations" (applicable from July 1, 2009). Company acquisitions shall in future continue to be reported using the acquisition method, but with certain important changes. Among other matters, the purchase amount at the time of acquisition shall be reported at fair value and ensuing conditional purchase payments shall be classified normally as liabilities/provisions. These liabilities are then re-evaluated as necessary via the income statement and do not therefore retroactively affect the acquisition value of the asset. The reason is that the re-evaluation is not considered to be related to the acquisition, but instead represents a changed situation after the acquisition. Minority interests in the acquired business may be valued optionally for each acquisition either at fair value or at the minority shareholders' proportional share of the acquired activity's net assets. Furthermore, all transaction costs shall be reported in the income statement directly they are no longer considered to represent a value in the acquired unit. The Group is applying the revised standard from January 1, 2010.  IFRIC 16 "Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation" (applicable from July 1, 2009). The interpretation is directed at treatment of hedging of net investment. The consideration is that hedges of net investments refer to the difference in functional currency and that hedge instruments can be used by any company within the Group as long as hedge reporting is in agreement with IAS 39. This is not expected to have an significant influence on the Group's financial reporting. Application is from January 1, 2010.

RISK MANAGEMENT
end of 2009, there was exposure of net assets in GBP relating to the acquisition of the caprolactones business in early 2008, for which no part of the loan was in GBP, see below.

3.1 Financial risk factors
The Group's finance policy stipulates the division of responsibility for financial operations. The policy also governs the financial risks the Group is prepared to take and stipulates guidelines for how the risks should be managed. Corporate Finance has global responsibility for the Group's financing activities. Currency risk The currency risk is the risk that the Group's earnings and net assets will be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. The Group has considerable flows of earnings and net assets in foreign currency, primarily in USD and EUR. As the diagram shows, a major proportion of sales is made in Europe, of which only 10 per cent in Sweden. In principle, all invoicing is in EUR or USD, which is also the case for purchases of raw materials. However, a large portion of costs is in SEK, as a result of one third of the Group's employees being based at plants in Sweden.

Financing risk The financing risk is the risk that the refinancing of loans will be impeded or will become costly. The Group's main financing consists of senior loans that have been guaranteed by Svenska Handelsbanken, Nordea, DnB NOR and HSH Nordbank and second liens and mezzanine facilities that were syndicated to over 20 financiers in 2006. These loan agreements have terms of seven to eight years and stipulate financial covenants pertaining to the fulfillment of key figures in terms of net debt in relation to EBITDA and EBITDA in relation to interest payments. During 2009 new capital was added from the Parent Company. In 2009 Perstorp renegotiated loan agreements with its bankers, including new levels for the financial key indicators to be achieved up to the due dates for the loans. There is also a ten-year Parent Company loan from Luxembourg-based Financière Forêt S.à.r.l. for which the 10percentage interest rate is being capitalized. During the year EUR 34 m of the Parent Company loan was converted into shareholders' equity.

The predicted transaction and consolidation exposure was not hedged at the end of 2009. The Group handles some of its exposure by borrowing in USD and EUR. This partly means that net inward flows of EUR and USD are reduced, as a result of interest payments, and partly that exposure of net assets in various currencies is reduced.

Parent Company loans are not included in the table because the interest is capitalized. Repayment of Parent Company loans including interest is expected to take place when ownership changes. The amount is dependent on the timing of the ownership change. The interest rates used correspond to rates on the closing date, Libor 90 days. Exchange rates also refer to rates on the closing date.

24

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed by checking that the Group has sufficient liquid funds and short-term investments as well as sufficient financing through agreed credit facilities. Management monitors forecasts of Group liquidity closely. The forecasts comprise unutilized promises of loans and liquidity on the basis of estimated cash flow. The table below shows the Group's financial liabilities and derivative instruments that constitute financial liabilities, distributed across the time remaining after the closing date up to the agreed due date. The amounts shown are agreed, undiscounted cash flows. Interest-rate risk The interest-rate risk is the risk that an increase in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on earnings. Interest-rate hedging is applied to fix interest rates for slightly more than half of the bank loans in accordance with the financial policy. On December 31, 2009, the average fixed-interest maturity was 240 days. The table below shows interest levels, fixed periods and sensitivity per currency. Sensitivity to interest rate changes is also shown in the diagram below. As shown, interest hedges radically reduce the interest rate risk, with a total of SEK -35 m per year for a 1 per cent rise in interest, from a level of SEK -116 m if no hedges had been made.

The Group's outstanding customer receivables on the closing date amounted to SEK 1,969 (2,132) m. This significant decrease mainly reflects lower price levels and exchange rates. The amounts reported are those that are expected to be repaid by customers based on an individual assessment of outstanding receivables and thereby including a reservation for expected/stated customer losses amounting to SEK 34 (29) m. To highlight the credit quality of receivables that have either fallen due for payment or have been written down, a maturity analysis is presented below (see note 18 for a maturity analysis of all accounts receivable). The book value of accounts receivable are equal to the fair value since the effect of discounting is not considered to be material. It should also be noted that it is not uncommon for a receivables to be settled shortly after the due date, which affects the maturity interval by 1-10 days. The Group's sales and thus also its accounts receivable are divided among a large number of customers spread across a wide geographic area. This limits the concentration of credit risk exposure. See diagram A below. The following diagram (B) shows the distribution of customers based on the size of their individual dealings with the Group at the end of the period. The segment with amounts due exceeding SEK 20 m refers to 10 (8) individual customers, the segment between SEK 10-20 m refers to 20 (22) individual customers, and thereafter the number of customers increases successively. The category of customer owing the Group less than SEK 1 m on the closing date corresponds to around 81 (82)% of all counter parties. On the closing date the Group had credit insurance, letters of credit or other pledged securities amounting to SEK 398 (73) m. Of these, SEK 32 (25) m is attributable to receivables that have fallen due for payment. Of receivables that have fallen due and which are associated with a limited credit risk due to pledged securities, SEK 32 (4) m are over 30 days due.

*) Financial liability excluding Parent Company loans and pension debt.

Counterparty risk/Customer sensitivity Counterparty risk relates to the credit risk that may arise when a counterparty cannot fulfil its commitments and thus causes a financial loss to the Group. A Group-wide credit policy is applied within the Perstorp Group, which all Group companies are obliged to follow, the main purpose of which is to prevent credit losses, minimize customer losses and optimize capital maturities in ways beneficial for the Group. Among other things the credit policy sets a framework for approving credit, who has responsibility and how deliveries may be approved in the event of a limit being exceeded or of a customer having credit that falls due for payment. Internal guidelines also include procedures for monitoring outstanding receivables before and after the maturity date depending on materiality and the individual customer's risk profile. In practice this is continually an intensive activity, especially considering the financial uncertainties in 2009.

3.2 Operational risk factors
Access to raw materials Most, 75-80%, of the Group's raw materials are based on oil or natural gas. For production of biodiesel the most important raw material is rapeseed oil, while rock salt (NaCl) is a key material in the production of the chlorine and lye produced at Perstorp's plant in Pont-de-Claix in France. Many of the Group's products are both sold externally and further processed internally. To safeguard supplies of raw materials and spread risks, the Group's purchasing policy requires that supplies of critical raw materials are made by several suppliers where possible. Supplies are secured through long-term delivery agreements. Perstorp operates on the global chemicals market with suppliers who meet the highest environmental and safety requirements, but as far as possible Perstorp aims to minimize transport by buying on local markets. Supplies of raw materials to Perstorp's site in Stenungsund ­ the largest site in Sweden in terms of volumes ­ are primarily made via pipelines direct from nearby producers. This eliminates storage costs and minimizes freight costs although it does entail a risk of being closely tied to a single supplier. Perstorp manages this risk through a terminal agreement that gives Perstorp the right to use the supplier's infrastructure for raw materials supplied by other producers. The price of crude oil and natural gas fluctuate constantly. To provide stability in the shorter perspective, Perstorp purchases raw materials using pricing formulas based on quarterly or monthly prices on each market where the raw material is used, with discounts and special terms negotiated. Opportunities for hedging raw material prices are assessed continually. To make this a possible alternative, Group policy requires a very strong correlation between the raw material price and the Group's own selling price. At the end of the year no raw material prices were hedged. In the historic perspective, the Group has ­ not least in 2008 and 2009 ­ been very successful in passing on increases in raw material prices along the customer chain. On the electricity market there is the possibility to secure prices for longer periods. In accordance with Group policy, electricity usage in Sweden is hedged over the coming six months at a range of 70-100% of expected usage and thereafter ­ for a maximum of three years ­ on a falling scale. From the seventh quarter the range is 0-40%. At the end of 2009 the market assessment of future electricity contracts had a negative effect on shareholders' equity of SEK 1 (-13) m after tax. Production disruptions Disruptions at Perstorp's plants may lead to a loss of earnings in the short term if the Group cannot deliver agreed volumes to customers and in the long term if this leads to alternative products taking over for the same application. Regular technical risk inspections are performed at production sites to minimize these risks. Perstorp has a global function whose job is to ensure that, in case of unforeseen events, the Group has complete insurance coverage while also supporting work aimed at minimizing risks. Through a global insurance program involving different international insurance companies the Group can exploit its size for competitive advantages.

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATE & JUDGEMENTS MADE FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSE

To a certain extent, the financial statements are based on estimates and judgements about the future trend. In turn, these judgements are based on historical experience and different assumptions that are considered to be reasonable in current circumstances. Reported values may have another actual outcome if other assumptions are made or circumstances change. The following particular areas can be distinguished where estimates and judgements are of importance to the amounts entered in the accounts and differences can have a significant effect on the Group's earnings and financial position. Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks: In accordance with the accounting principle described in point 2.10, impairment testing is currently performed annually through analysis of individual assets'/cash-generating units' recovery value. A number of important assumptions are used in this analysis, see note 6. Valuation of tax-loss carryforwards: The valuation of tax-loss carryforwards is based on an assessment that it will be possible to utilize these carryforwards in the foreseeable future. Assessments are based on, among other matters, an assumption about future business opportunities and earnings capability. The outcome is often dependent on tax rules that are current or likely to come into effect. Tax-loss carryforwards have been assigned values in, primarily, the Group's companies in Sweden, France, the UK and Singapore. For booked values see note 23. Pension benefits: The current value of the Group's future pension commitments regarding defined-benefit pension plans are based on a number of assumptions in connection with the actuarial estimate. Changes in these assumptions may affect the reported value of the pension commitment. For further details, see chapter 2.12 and note 22. Perstorp's financial accounts are based on the going-concern principle, which is also reflected in how any environmental liabilities are assessed. The Group complies with decisions by public authorities and conducts measures both proactively to prevent environmental impact and reactively in the event that environmental disturbances arise. In 2005 independent environmental assessments were performed of all the sites. These inquiries did not result in any material environmental observations.

note 5

SEGMENT INFORMATION

To a very great extent, the specialty chemicals operations are integrated both horizontally, since the same product can often be manufactured in several units/countries, and vertically, by being intermediates in the next product. Virtually all products are sold to customers that at this level are far removed from the end customers in the form of automakers, coatings producers and so forth. The same product can often be used for a wide spectrum of applications. Accordingly, there is no natural reason to divide the specialty chemicals operations into different segments. At present there is no formal requirement for companies whose stocks are not subject to general trading to follow IFRS/IAS. This factor, together with the lack of a natural basis for dividing segments in accordance with IFRS 8 means that the Group has chosen to exclude this information. Sales per geographical market are presented in note 3, Risk Management.

Other intangible assets refer to tenancy rights, development costs, advance payments for intangible assets, REACH and non-compete agreements in connection with acquisitions. Acquisition of subsidiaries refers to the acquisition in 2008 of assets in the caprolactones business and Coating Additives. The acquisition analysis for Coating Additives was established in 2009 resulting in reclassifications, primarily among intangible assets, and an adjustment of the purchase amount by around EUR 8 m, which reduced intangible assets.

Depreciation costs of SEK 90 (66) m are included in costs of sold goods, SEK 200 (165) m in sales costs and SEK 4 (0) m in administrative costs. Leasing costs in the form of tenancy rights in connection with the acquisition of the business in Chile are included in write-down of SEK 6 (depreciation, 1) m. Write-downs are included in the other operating costs item. Know-how and customer relations are depreciated linearly. The remaining average life length is 25 (30) and 13 (16) years respectively. Non-compete agreements acquired in 2008 are depreciated linearly over 6 years. For further details concerning accounting principles for intangible assets, see note 2.6. The bank loans are secured by patents at a value of EUR 47 (47) m. Impairment testing The cash-generating units comprise Specialty Chemicals, Formox, Caprolactones, PIA and Coating Additives. Recoverable amounts for a cash-generating unit are established on the basis of calculations of value in use. These calculations are based on estimates of future cash flow, in accordance with financial five-year plans that have been approved by management. Cash flows beyond this five-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2%. The discount interest rate amounts to 9.6% after tax. Considering the turbulence of the global economy in 2009 the sensitivity analysis was performed using a discount factor of 10.5%, which did not produce an impairment requirement. The impairment test did not therefore motivate an impairment requirement. Other impairment amounting to SEK 241 m in total was performed (for both tangible and intangible assets) relating mainly to the Valex project, which has changed in focus and scope. Assets in Chile, India and China were impaired during the year in connection with rationalization of the production equipment. Intangible assets were affected by SEK 6 m in impairment, relating to tenancy rights in Chile. A further SEK 235 m affected tangible fixed assets.

Assets not depreciated ­ goodwill and trademarks from acquisition Goodwill and the trademarks assigned a value in connection with the acquisition allocation following the acquisition of the Group at the end of 2005 (Perstorp and Formox) have been adjudged to have an unlimited life. Goodwill and trademarks for the acquired caprolactones business and Coating Additives were added in 2008. A summary of the allocation per cash-generating unit, for goodwill and trademarks, is presented below.

The Group's tangible fixed assets were assessed in 2006 in connection with an acquisition analysis. The assessment was based on replacement cost, remaining life and the difference in operating costs between newly acquired plants and existing ones. The re-assessment, after deductions for deferred tax, were credited to Other reserves under Shareholders' equity. In 2008, tangible assets attributable primarily to the caprolactones business and Coating Additives were added under the heading `Acquisition of subsidiaries'. No borrowing costs due to investments have been capitalized during 2008 and 2009. Work in progress mainly refers to the Valex project.

Of which, current financial leasing liabilities accounted for SEK 29 (17) m and long-term leasing liabilities for SEK 20 (30) m.

The Net debt includes secured loans (bank loans and other borrowing against collateral) of SEK 2,671 (2,753) m pertaining to buildings and land, SEK 486 (514) m relating to patents and SEK 1,555 (1,724) m pertaining to chattel mortgages.

These loan agreements include quarterly key indicators linked to net debt in relation to EBITDA, EBITDA in relation to interest payments, and the level of investments and available credit facilities. The level of net debt compared with EBITDA is also of importance for the interest level in certain loans. During 2009 Perstorp reached an agreement concerning new bank covernants with its owners and banks. The maturity structure was adjusted slightly but the final due dates for the facilities are unchanged.

In accordance with the Group's finance policy, interest rate hedging is applied in order to fix the interest rates for at least half of the bank loans. Around 65% of interest rates were hedged at the end of the year for an average period of around one year. Accordingly, the actual average period of fixed interest is 240 days. At the end of 2009, market valuation of the interest rate hedging contracts had an impact of SEK -108 (-126) m after tax on the Group's shareholders' equity. In addition to these loans, loans from the Parent Company in Luxembourg amount to SEK 2,899 m, which have a duration of up to 10 years, but which are extended automatically during up to five periods assuming that none of the parties concerned terminate the agreement. The interest rate amounts to 10%.

The Group handles the cash flow exposure in different currencies by taking up loans in EUR and US-dollar. This means that the net inflow in these currencies is reduced, due to interest payments, but also that the net assets exposure by currency is reduced. At the end of 2009 there was above all net asset exposure in GBP, as a consequence of the acquisition of the caprolactone business early in 2008, since no part of the loans was taken up in GBP. D.

G. Market valuation of financial instruments The Group arranges its loans on market terms. For external loans, interest terms are based on underlying official market rates plus an interest margin. When these loans are not subject to organized trading, an objective market assessment is not possible. The fair value of financial instruments traded on active markets is based on listed market prices on the closing date. Assessment techniques, such as calculation of discounted cash flows, are used to establish fair value for remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest swaps is calculated as the present value of assessed future cash flows. The fair value of electricity hedge contracts are established through the use of listed rates for electricity contracts on the closing date. The reported value, after provisions, of accounts receivable and accounts payable are judged to correspond to fair value, as these items are short term.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS & COSTS

The Group has both defined-contribution and defined-benefit pension plans. During the year costs for these plans had an accumulative effect on earnings of SEK 212 (223) m, of which SEK 160 (203) m is attributable to defined-contribution plans and SEK 52 (20) m to defined-benefit plans. Pension costs attributable to restructuring of SEK 1 (45) m are included in the accumulated amount. The distribution of costs in the income statement is as follows:

A. Pension costs the income statement SEK m Cost of sold goods Sales and marketing costs Administrative costs Research and development costs Non comparable items Net financial items Total 2009 92 36 45 11 1 27 212 2008 99 25 33 14 45 7 223

Defined-contribution pension plans There are defined-contribution pension plans in most of the countries in which the Group is active. In the Swedish units, these mainly consist of state pension contributions and negotiated pensions for blue-collar workers. In the United States, such plans are called 401K and in Germany they are called Staatliche Rente and Pensionskasse, etc. The costs that are capitalized during the year attributable to defined-contribution pensions plans can be classified as follows:

B. Pension costs, defined contribution plans SEK m State pension plans Other defined-contribution pension plans ITP, insured through Alecta Total, pension costs, defined-contribution plans 2009 59 53 48 160 2008 74 67 62 203

Most of the Group's Swedish companies have secured their obligations for old-age and family pensions via pension insurance with Alecta. In accordance with a statement by the Swedish Financial Accounting Standards Council, UFR3, this is a definedbenefit plan that covers several employers. For the 2008 and 2009 financial years the Group did not have access to information that enabled it to report this plan as a defined-benefit pension plan, so it is therefore reported as a defined-contribution pension plan. The surplus at Alecta may be divided between the plan provider or the insured. At year-end 2009, Alecta's surplus in the form of its collective funding ratio amounted to 112% (152).The collective funding ratio equals the market value of Alecta's assets, in percentage of the insurance obligations as computed in accordance with Alecta's actuarial calculation assumptions; this does not comply with IAS 19. Defined-benefit pension plans There are defined-benefit pension plans in most of the companies and countries in which the Group is active. The main provisions for defined-benefit pension plans pertain to the Pension Registration Institute (PRI), Indemnités de Fin de Carriére (IFC) (France), Pensionszulage (Germany), pension plans for employees in certain currently divested units and specific pension insurance plans for senior executives in various countries. In the table below, the defined-benefit pension obligations are specified, divided into funded and unfunded pension plans.

The plan assets presented here relate primarily to Group companies in the US, 94% (93), of which 66% (53) are invested in stocks and 34% (47) in bonds as interest-bearing securities. The expected return is assumed to be 9.0% (9.0) and 4.6% (5.8) respectively, which is based on historic returns. The actual return on plan assets in 2009, in absolute numbers, was SEK 34 (-47) m. In addition to the above, so-called direct pensions are included under assets and liabilities at SEK 66 (59) m. The asset is capital insurance, with assets and liabilities reported separately at gross amounts. Healthcare insurance is not included in pension commitments. Development during the year for the Group's commitments, plan assets and unrecognized actuarial profit/loss is presented below:

H. Parent Company The Parent Company reports a pension expense of SEK 18 (7) m, which is solely based on defined-contribution plans as there were no benefit-based pension plans at the end of the two most recent financial years. For classification reasons, the entire amount is reported as administration costs in the income statement. It should also be noted that SEK 0 (2) m of the cost is attributable to restructuring.

The tax on pretax earnings differs as follows from the theoretical amount that would have arisen from applying a weighted average tax rate for the earnings in the consolidated companies: Tax cost 2009 Pretax earnings Tax computed on the basis of national tax rates applying in each particular country Adjustment for different tax rates in different countries 1) Non-taxable revenues Non-tax-deductible costs Adjustment due to changed tax regulations Adjustment due to new judgments Tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax asset has been recognized Tax cost not related to current year's profit/loss and other tax expenses Tax cost

The effective tax rate is adjudged to be 32 % (30) for 2009. Because tax rates differ for profits and losses, the effective tax rate can be misleading, depending on the size of the results. The rise in effective tax for 2009 is solely dependent on the unusually large losses generated in countries with relatively high tax rates (France in particular).

Deferred tax assets relate to tax loss carryforwards mainly in Sweden, France, the UK and Singapore. To some extent they may be matched against deferred tax liabilities.

There were no bonuses in 2009. Bonus and other remuneration refers to restructuring cost, other remuneration than bonus and changes in reservation for bonus 2008.

The reported payments pertain to the remuneration expensed for the 2009 fiscal year, certain portions of which will be paid in 2010. The Chairman of the Board is employed by the company, which is reflected in the above salary, bonus and pension costs. In addition to the above salary, the chairman has invoiced SEK 40 k (600) from his own company pertaining to part of the Board assignment. The deputy chairman has invoiced consulting fees of SEK 300 k (0), and the former deputy CEO has invoiced consulting fees of SEK 2,114 k (0), for the period March-August. Other members of Group management comprised 8 (10) persons during the year. During 2009, other members of Group Management exchanged bonus payments of SEK 437 k (671) for pensions. Of the total amount concerning salary, remuneration and pensions for Group Management, SEK 3,547 k (5,043) refer to the completed restructuring program. Principles Members of the Board receive director fees in accordance with resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting. Employee representatives do not receive director fees. For 2009, director fees were paid to the deputy chairman only. Remuneration to the President and other members of Group management comprises basic salary, variable remuneration, company car and pensions. The President is also entitled to a bonus corresponding to a maximum of 100% (100) of his fixed salary. Other members of Group management are covered by a bonus system that provides a maximum of 35% (35) of their basic salary. The variable remuneration is based partly on the Group's earnings trend and cash flow and partly on the fulfillment of various functionbased targets by each individual. Pension & employment termination An occupational pension has been taken out for the President corresponding to 33.7% (56.3) of his basic salary. According to a special undertaking, the employment contract can be terminated by both the company and the President as of age 60. The period of employment-termination notice is one year if notice is served by the Company and six months if it is served by the President. If the Company terminates the President's employment, the President will also receive severance pay corresponding to 12 monthly salaries. If organizational changes or other changes initiated by the owners results in significant limitations on the President's responsibility or authority, the President is entitled under certain circumstances to terminate his employment and be subject to the same employment termination terms as those that would have applied if the Company had terminated his employment. Other members of Group Management are covered by an agreement regarding pension insurance schemes, the aim of which is to enable the executives concerned to retire at age 60. The period of employment-termination notice for other members of Group Management is six months. If the Company terminates the employment of a member of Group Management, the sum total of salary during the period of notice, severance pay and corresponding benefits will be paid for 12 months to a maximum of 18 months.

THE GROUP´S

KEY EVENTS IN 2009
 Work aimed at reducing the environmental impact of process water has been very successful. The hydraulic impact was cut by
13% at Perstorp. The reverse osmosis technique resulted in a cut of 50% in contamination at Bruchhausen. Toledo managed to cut water contamination by 40%.

 Most production sites reduced their energy consumption through process improvements.  Some production units reduced their waste streams by developing processes so that items previously considered to be waste
could be used as products in new applications. One example of this is waste methanol from production at Toledo.

 Many sites have completed processsafety projects, especially PontdeClaix, where a lot of time has been spent on risk and
consequence analyses in accordance with French PPRT legislation.

 The production sites at Perstorp, Stenungsund, Bruchhausen and Toledo have been very successful with their Take Care
behaviorbased safety projects in 2009.

 Major efforts have been carried out in connection with the EU's REACH chemicals safety legislation.

Responsible business
Responsibility is one of Perstorp's core values, permeating all activities. This has many aspects and includes taking responsibility for staff and providing good working conditions and development opportunities for everyone, being a good employer in the local community, and working for sustainable development in terms of the environment and opportunities for coming generations. The following environmental impact aspects have the most significance from a global perspective:
 Consumption of raw materials, energy and non-renewable resources  Emissions of greenhouse gases and volatile organic substances  Consumption of water and contamination of water Governance & measurement
Perstorp's policies

The Perstorp Group has a policy for the environment, health and safety, and a policy for Human Resources. They are available at www.perstorp.com
Management system

The Perstorp Group's internal requirements cover external certification in accordance with ISO 9000 and the ISO 14001 environment management system. In 2009 some of Perstorp's plants renewed their ISO 14001 certification. Certification is planned for the Freeport and Pont-de-Claix units in 2010, and for Warrington and Waspik in 2011.
Reporting principles & GRI index

Perstorp therefore takes great consideration of these aspects in the development of existing plants and processes, as well as in the design of new plants.
Code of Conduct & UN Global Compact

Details about work performed within the environment, health and safety areas for 2009 have been retrieved from the Group's databases. Facts include those reported to the authorities and information used for internal controls. This annual report provides information for an assessment of how Perstorp meets Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators. Perstorp is currently applying level C and has chosen not to carry out an external audit for 2009.
Awards

Responsibility in practice is also confirmed in print. In 2009 a new, expanded Code of Conduct was distributed to all employees. It covers four areas: Business Principles, Products & the Environment, Working Conditions and Human Rights. Special attention is paid to the EU's competition regulations since a lot of co-operation with competitors is taking place within the framework of the REACH legislation. Since 2004 Perstorp is also participating in the UN's Global Compact initiative and its principles concerning human rights, the environment, working conditions and anti-corruption measures. In 2009 there have been no reported cases of discrimination, child labor or enforced labor, nor have there been any cases of corruption.

The Toledo plant received an award from the American Chemistry Council at the start of the year for successful measures aimed at improving efficiency and reducing consumption of natural gas. The plant at Pont-de-Claix also received a prize for its response to a road accident.
Production permits

Most units received new permits or renewed permits during 2009. New permits will be required in 2010 to increase production, while the unit at Pont-de-Claix will have to apply for a permit in accordance with French PPRT legislation.

The environment
Perstorp's goals for the environment, health & safety in 2009 Over the past three years, Perstorp has focused on three main goals ­ reducing energy and water consumption and reducing the number of work-related accidents.

2)

Perstorp's goals for environment, health & safety in 2010
Reduced water & energy

By reducing consumption of process water, emissions to water are reduced. The Perstorp production unit reduced process water streams by around 13%, which further reduced the need for incoming water. The contamination level of process water at the Bruchhausen production unit fell by 50% by using the reverse osmosis technique while the Toledo plant managed to cut contamination in water by 40%.
Outcomes ­ work-related accidents

Perstorp's goals for 2010 are to continue cutting consumption of water and energy from 2009 levels calculated per ton of product.
Analysis of carbon footprint

The target for 2009 was to reach a figure of LTAR of <2, which means that the number of work-related accidents causing more than one day of sick leave per million worked hours should be less than two. The number of accidents involving sick leave was 14 (11). Perstorp did not reach its LTAR target: the result was 3.5 (3.2) for 2009. Most accidents involved falls from steps or slipping. The increase is also due to the addition of the Business Group Coating Additives to the statistics.
Environmental accidents

During the year Perstorp will analyze the carbon footprint of a number of its products, i.e. the impact of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere.
Fewer work-related accidents

The target remains to achieve an LTAR quota of less than two. A processsafety program with a zero vision will be introduced to make it easier to perform risk assessment of process incidents and spread knowledge among the Group's sites. Perstorp aims continuously to develop production units in accordance with best available technology. This work involves continuous risk assessment if incidents occur and implementing preventive measures to avoid injury and damage. The Take Care project is an example of this. New tools will also be introduced to perform process safety analyses.

Environmental accidents are accidents affecting the environment outside the retained area. In 2009 there were 4 (6) accidents, spillages without significant consequences. The number of Take Care observations in 2009 was 1,860, an increase of 67% on 2008.

Energy

Emissions & environmental impact
Emissions to air

The unit at Toledo ­ where energy consumption has been reduced by extracting even more steam from formalin production ­ is just one example of the many successful energy projects completed in 2009. At Freeport, process improvements enabled consumption of natural gas to be reduced, while at Pont-de-Claix enhancements of the steam system and installation of extra heat exchanger units helped to cut energy consumption. During 2009 consumption of energy by the Perstorp Group amounted to 3,236 (2,084) GWh of which 1,926 (624) GWh came from external producers. Of the electricity and steam produced internally, 16% is from renewable fuel. Of externally produced energy, 6% is from renewable fuel.
Raw materials & fresh water

Several production sites have succeeded in their efforts to reduce emissions to air. At Pont-de-Claix emissions of carbon monoxide from production of HDI have been cut by 30% while at Warrington the installation of a new condenser has lead to reduction in volatile organic compounds by 20 kg per hour. In Stenungsund a new steam boiler will be started up in the spring of 2010 which will enable further cuts in emissions of nitric oxides.
Emissions of carbon dioxide

In 2009 Perstorp's total emissions of carbon dioxide amounted to 773,000 tons of which 91,000 tons were carbon dioxide from renewable fuels. The production site at Perstorp produced 548 GWh of energy, of which 234 GWh, or 43%, was from renewable fuel. Perstorp's production sites in Sweden delivered a total of 154 GWh of district heating to local municipalities in 2009. In addition to district heating the Perstorp site delivered 51 GWh of steam to other companies on the industrial site.
Emissions of ozone-depleting compounds

During 2009, the Perstorp Group used 74 (25) million cubic meters of fresh water. Of this amount, 49 (17) Mm3 was surface water, 23 (6.8) Mm3 was groundwater, 0.9 (0.9) Mm3 was from the municipal supply and 0.5 (0.5) Mm3 was supplied from other external sources. The large increase was due to the new Coating Additives business area. Of the total volume of 74 Mm3 of fresh water, 47 Mm3 is cooling water used at the Pont-de-Claix production site. Perstorp uses a wide variety of raw materials in its processes ­ for example, methanol, propylene, natural gas, sodium chloride, nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and toluene. These substances are converted by Perstorp, for example to produce formalin, butyraldehyde, polyols and toluene diisocyanate. The Group aims to deliver as much as possible in bulk to reduce the amount of packaging.

To reduce emissions of ozone-depleting compounds, Perstorp has intensified preventive maintenance and replaced the cooling equipment at Castellanza in Italy. The Coating Additives business area is a new addition to the 2009 statistics and this has resulted in an increase of both the total installed amount of ozone-depleting compounds as well as leakages. The total amount of ozone-depleting compounds was 15 tons. The leakage in 2009 amounted to 2.3 tons, or 15% of the installed amount.

Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC)

Waterborne contaminants

During 2009 the VOC emissions to air by the Perstorp Group amounted to 312 (239) tons. Organic solvents have contributed to the rise, as has the use of toluene at the Pont-de-Claix plant. Previously, the largest single volatile compound was methanol, emissions from which totaled 28 (74) tons in 2009.
Emissions of sulfur dioxide & nitric oxides

Perstorp is fully aware that water is becoming a limited resource and therefore makes great efforts to improve in this area. Most production sites managed to reduce their consumption of water during the year and thus cut emissions of waterborne contaminants, partly by re-circulation and partly by using water streams in series for different process stages. At the Perstorp site process water was sent from a polyol plant back to the formalin plant while at the Bruchhausen plant the technique of reversed osmosis lead to improvements. In Toledo CODs were cut by 40% and in Gent process water streams were used as a carbon source in the external water treatment plant. The Perstorp and Toledo sites account for the largest emissions to water within the Group. At the sites in Perstorp, Stenungsund, Castellanza, Vapi, Zibo and Singapore, emissions are treated within the site area. Other sites are connected to municipal treatment plants.
Soil

Perstorp's emissions of sulfur dioxide mainly come from burning fuel that contains sulfur. In 2009 the Group emitted 205 (227) tons of sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitric oxides, also from incineration operations, amounted to 277 (229) tons.
Waste

Several of Perstorp's plants have improved their management of waste streams. In Toledo a previous waste stream of methanol is now being sold instead to external customers while at Castellanza a so-called mother lye stream was modified so that it can be sold. At Stenungsund reducing the amount of metals in waste sludge has meant that the sludge now can be reclassified as non-hazardous waste. The total amount of waste for the Perstorp Group amounted to 67,000 (60,000) tons in 2009. A great deal remains to be done internally in the field of energy recovery, within Perstorp, for example concerning waste methanol at Perstorp, reaction mother lye at Bruchhausen and isocyanates at Pont-de-Claix. At the Perstorp site volatile return products are received from other production sites within the Group: 320 tons from Warrington and Gent, and 6,570 tons of waste methanol from the production site at Perstorp. By recycling this into energy the need for fossil fuels is reduced.

Activities to decrease soil contamination are being carried out at Pont-de-Claix following an incident that took place prior to Perstorp taking over the plant.
Transport

As part of efforts to reduce climate impact the Perstorp Group has strict requirements regarding engine and fuel types when purchasing external transport. Surveys are used to ensure the correct environmental performance profile. A new harbor pier is being constructed at Stenungsund to reduce waiting times for ships arriving in port. As a producer of Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME), Perstorp is working to increase the usage of this fuel for truck transport.

Costs for handling waste amounted to SEK 51.5 (18.5) m. During the year the Group paid around SEK 31 (22.4) m for waste water and around SEK 60.6 (22.9) m for administration of environmental measures. Administrative costs include costs for environmental personnel, maintenance of environment management systems and external consulting services. The reason for increased costs compared with 2008 addition of the two new plants in the Coating Additives business group to the statistics.
Environmental liabilities Perstorp's economic reporting is based on the "going concern" principle, which is reflects in how environmental liabilities are reported. The Group follows verdicts handed down by the authorities while acting proactively to prevent environmental impacts and reactively in the event of an environmental disturbance. Investment in the environment, health & safety Total investment in the environment, health and safety amounted to SEK 85.9 (51.8) m in 2009, or 14.1 (8.8)% of the Group's total investment.

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT | SAFETY & HUMAN RESOURCES

Safety
Working environment
Work-related accidents & sick leave

During the year Perstorp has continued to work on reducing sick leave and the number of work-related accidents. The new scheme for continuous improvement, Perstorp Performance System, focuses sharply on safety. The behavior-based safety program, Take Care, is a key component. Sick leave throughout the Group remains at a low level, 2.5 % (2.4 %), but the number of accidents in the workplace that resulted in absence from work increased slightly to 14 (11).
Physical fitness

As part of REACH registration, producers shall explain how chemicals are used safely. Risks associated with the properties of the chemicals shall be compared with exposure during use. Safe use involves also the use of Personal Protection Equipment, PPE. In 2009 Perstorp communicated intensively with customers and suppliers to ensure that Perstorp's products, and the raw materials used by Perstorp, can be handled safely in future. Perstorp is also active in a number of consortiums and so-called SIEFs (Substance Information Exchange Forum) in which companies that must register the same substance work together to produce documentation to ensure correct registration. Perstorp has chosen to take complete responsibility for producing registration information for the products where the company is the sole producer in Europe. Alongside REACH, legislation is being introduced concerning Classification Labeling and Packaging (CLP) based on the UN's Global Harmonized System (GHS). This governs how chemicals are classified and labeled. CLP/GHS resulted in Perstorp intensifying work in 2009 on the implementation of a completely new system of symbols for chemical substances. This work will be completed in 2010.
Training in the environment, health & safety

To promote good health and job satisfaction, strengthen team spirit and reduce sick leave, all Perstorp employees shall, to the most possible extent, have access to opportunities for improving physical fitness. The production site in Perstorp, for example, has a gym, a group fitness session and a sports centre for ball sports and exercise bikes.
Company healthcare services

External suppliers provide company healthcare services to Perstorp, meaning that the service provided varies at the different production sites. In addition to vaccinations and health checks based on age and working environment, great importance is attached to preventive measures that involve ergonomics and stress management. To help people get back to work after illness, swift rehabilitation measures are offered, adapted to individual requirements.
Product safety

In 2009, 3,800 participants completed 30,550 hours of training.

Work on product safety in 2009 focused on the extensive preparations required for registration of Perstorp's products in accordance with the EU's REACH program ­ Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemicals. The first registration phase for produced and imported chemical substances (over 1,000 tons per year) shall be completed in 2010.

PERSTORP PERFORMANCE SYSTEM
The new scheme for continuous improvement, Perstorp Performance System, focuses sharply on safety. The behaviorbased safety program, Take Care, is a key component. Take Care aims at changing staff behavior and thus reducing the number of accidents in the workplace.

Perstorp has chosen to take complete responsibility for producing registration information for the products where the company is the sole producer in Europe.

Human resources
Competence procurement In a company such as Perstorp it is important to recruit the brightest talents. Perstorp therefore works in the short and long term to market the process industry in general and the chemicals industry in particular to young people and teachers.

Most of Perstorp's production sites work with local universities and colleges. Staff give guest lectures, participate in job market presentations and the company offers opportunities for work experience and for students to do their theses. Perstorp also tries to encourage younger people to become interested in chemistry. In Stenungsund, Perstorp is involved in an experiment centre called the Molecule Workshop where pre-school children can get their first introduction to science. At the site at Perstorp the company also runs Perstorp Gymnasium, with a chemical-technical program. The key aspect is to offer interesting job assignments that lead to personal development and a satisfying career. In 2009 Perstorp's HR department developed new processes so that each employee has a development plan with specific targets. Staff can choose to have a career in management with responsibility for others, be a project manager or become an expert in a specific field. This process also ensures that all development is in line with the company's future competence requirements.
Diversity & equality Perstorp's diversity and equality policy builds on the principle that all employees should have equal opportunities to develop at work. Perstorp is convinced that diversity in the workplace, in terms of age, gender, nationality or level of education, creates a climate that result in an increased creativity, productivity and job satisfaction.

Group activities are based on the UN's Global Compact principles. The initiative is run more structurally in countries where there is legislation to follow, such as the US with its diversity laws, and Sweden and Germany that have equality laws, but all production sites follow the Group's policy in this issue. The new HR process ensures that the company has a broad base from which to make key job appointments, and that men, women and people with different nationalities are encouraged just as actively to develop in their careers. Recent acquisitions have meant that more of Perstorp's staff now come from outside Sweden. This automatically makes the base for selection wider and creates new opportunities for working in countries with different cultures.

"Safe and motivated employees do a better job."

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT | KEY REL ATIONS & SOCIET Y

Key relations
Customers Perstorp strives to establish long-term relations with customers and considers that an open and honest dialogue forms the right foundation. Customer satisfaction is measured annually in surveys to help follow up and improve the level of service experienced by customers. Perstorp checks to see that deliveries are correct and that complaints are dealt with efficiently and quickly. Suppliers The long-term view is essential in relations with suppliers. Perstorp requires that suppliers share Perstorp's views on the environment, health and safety. The company's Code of Conduct forms the basis for assessments of new suppliers. Industry organizations Perstorp is active in a number of industry organizations on the national and international level, including the Swedish Plastics and Chemicals Federation and CEFIC at EU level. Competitors Perstorp's Code of Conduct states that all departments and employees must be aware of, and act in accordance with, the company's competition policy that covers the legislative requirements and the company's own ethical rules applying to this matter. This means that Perstorp must be a strong but just competitor. Schools & universities Co-operation with schools and universities is important for Perstorp's long-term recruitment initiatives. Each site therefore works together with local schools.

Society
Information to the general public Open and honest communication is important for a responsible citizen such as Perstorp. The Group provides environmental information to the general public in its reports, via the mass media and Internet and in various brochures. Open House & study visits Open House activities are organized regularly at a number of the Group's sites for employees' families and local residents. Perstorp's sites also regularly receive visits by various interest groups including universities, colleges, politicians, companies, pensioners and various kinds of associations. Complaints Questions and complaints from the general public are registered and addressed in accordance with ISO 14001 management system procedures. In 2009 the Stenungsund site received three complaints concerning noise related to flaring. The Pont-de-Claix site registered three complaints concerning noise and odors from the TDI process. The Zibo site paid a fine connected to a waste water overflow. Authorities Perstorp submits safety reports and risk assessments to the authorities in accordance with current legislation. The production sites provide information about their activities to the general public at regular intervals.

ANNUAL REPORT 2009 | PART 2 | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Corporate governance report

The Group's core values with the focus on innovation, reliability and responsibility underpin the entire business and are also central to corporate governance. Corporate governance includes the continual process of controlling and improving decisionmaking and business strategies, defining clear areas of responsibility and identifying and evaluating opportunities and risks for the Group. The overall aim is to maintain and develop order so that the business is controlled reliably and we are well equipped to face the development challenges and changes of the future. The Group does not have a formal requirement to follow the Swedish code of corporate governance, but since this is an important issue for Perstorp, a general presentation of the corporate governance structure is given here.

2009

General Meeting The General Meeting is the forum where shareholders make decisions about the urgent matters facing Perstorp Holding AB and its sub-groups. The Annual General Meeting was held on 5 May 2009, at which the annual report for 2008 was adopted together with the proposal for distribution of profits. The Board of Directors was elected and new articles of association were adopted. The main changes in the latter were an extended description of activities and an increase in the number of directors from five to six.

also regulate the division of responsibility between the Board, its committees and the President. In practice the work of the Board is lead by the chairman. The position of Chairman was held by Lennart Holm up to the end of March 2009 when he was replaced by Bo Dankis. Lennart Holm has remained on the Board and is now the Deputy Chairman. The division of responsibilities among Board members does not extend beyond certain special assignments for the Chairman. During 2009, eight scheduled Board meetings were held, as well as the statutory first convening meeting and five extra meetings. Minutes are kept at all meetings. On average, attendance at Board meetings for ordinary Board members has been 89%. Other employees have also attended meetings, either to make presentations or give specialist information prior to key decisions. Every month the Board receives a written report on the development of the Group and the earnings and financial position. Preparatory materials are sent to Board members before each Board meeting. The President is also in continuous contact with the Chairman of the Board. The following points are addressed at each Board meeting: Status report from the President; Financial position and outlook; Investment decision for projects worth more than SEK 15 m; Decisions on changes in Group structure; Financial structure issues; Structural and organizational issues; Other important matters. In addition to these fixed points, a number of main subjects are addressed during the year, for example, the establishment of the budget in November-December. The five extra Board meetings in 2009 were held to address forecasts for the business, plans for the Group, refinancing, financial structure and organizational management changes.
Audit Committee The Board is served by an Audit Committee which focuses on securing

There were no Extra General Meetings in 2009 apart from a meeting at the start of the year when Ragnar Hellenius was voted onto the Board, replacing Colm O'Sullivan who moved on to another assignment within PAI partners.
Board of Directors The Board of Directors consists of six members, with two deputies all nominated and elected by the company owner. The individuals elected to the Board at the 2009 AGM were Bo Dankis, Lennart Holm, Fabrice Fouletier, Bertrand Meunier, Ragnar Hellenius and Claes Gard. The first five members were re-elected while Claes Gard was elected as the sixth Board member. Claes Gard was previously (2001-2009) CFO of the Perstorp Group. Julio Varela and Gaëlle d'Engremont were elected for an additional period. In addition to the aforementioned individuals the Board also includes employee representatives.

Bertrand Meunier resigned from the Board at his own request in December 2009. His position was taken by another owner representative, Michel Paris, in early 2010. The responsibilities of the Board are regulated by the Swedish Companies Act and the formal working procedures, which are approved by the Board once a year. These procedures outline the assignments of the Board and which decisions must be taken at Board level. The working procedures

the quality of the Group's financial reporting and risk management and the committee is therefore also close to the development of control instruments for internal control. An important activity is to follow up and assess the external audit. The committee does not have decisionmaking rights. Decisions shall be made by the Board. In 2009 the audit committee consisted of the following members: Fabrice Fouletier, Bo Dankis and Claes Gard, plus CFO Johan Malmqvist. During the year the committee held three ordinary meetings. Minutes were taken at all meetings.
Remuneration Committee The Board is also served by a Remuneration Committee. The task of this committee is to establish principles for remuneration and other employment terms for the President and senior executives. The committee also prepares the terms for global incentive schemes and makes an assessment of the schemes. The committee has no decision-making powers, and it is the Board of Directors that takes the ultimate decisions in these matters. In 2009 the remuneration committee consisted of Board members Bo Dankis, Lennart Holm and Bertrand Meunier plus the Group's President Martin Lundin. The committee held one ordinary meeting during the year which was minuted. Operating Management Group As a result of the financial turbulence that entered the global economy at the end of 2008 the Board decided to appoint a small operating management group reporting directly to the Board. This group includes four principal decision makers: Martin Lundin, Mats Persson, Lennart Hagelqvist and Martin White. The purpose was not to replace the Group Management team but to create a flexible, smaller group solely focused on controlling Perstorp during an uncertain period. Through weekly meetings and close follow-up of the business, intimate control was established and decisions were made without delay. When economic conditions stabilized after a couple of months the group began reporting to the Group Management team instead of the Board in March. Work continued but was phased out gradually during the second half of 2009. President & Group Management Bo Dankis was the President and CEO of Perstorp Holding AB at the start of 2009. In March 2009 he was also appointed as chairman of the Group and Martin Lundin was appointed deputy CEO to create the best conditions as Bo Dankis took up the new position. A succession took place on 1 September, when Martin Lundin formally took over the role of President and CEO of Perstorp Holding AB.

During the year PwC performed assignments relating to the audit but in addition to regular auditing work. On all of those occasions the Group has emphasized that the additional services shall not compromise the independence of the audit, which has also been carefully examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Internal control For Perstorp the concept of internal control is fundamental and involves the Group's capability for implementing an effective system for control and follow up of the company's activities. It also involves ensuring that rules are followed, both with regard to external legislation/regulation and internal guidelines/control documents. An important part of the practical work on internal controls, furthermore, is to identify risks and ensure that they are managed efficiently. The purpose is to minimize risk exposure as far as possible in selected areas while also ensuring the opportunities are exploited as desired.

The Group's organization is adapted to meet the requirements for good internal control and working methods are characterized by organizational transparency with a clear division of responsibility. In 2009 further decision-making powers were given to Perstorp's three business areas. They thus gained greater responsibility for the Group's economic reports with shared guidelines, instructions and systems managed and developed at Group level. It is important that the Group's global values and rules are also reflected in the new units. This includes compliance with the Group's financial reporting manual, which together with the business systems are important control instruments that enable reliable consolidation and financial reporting. Group reports are produced once a month following wellestablished procedures, and the outcome is always presented in a report which includes extensive analysis. Work on the year-end accounts involves a number of people at Group, department and company level, and the summarized results are reported back continually to management functions and the Board. During 2009 the department for internal controls continued to implement the project that involves an extensive internal assessment. As with the previous year, the operational subsidiaries were subject to the assessment along with a number of holding companies. The purpose is to identify key control points for the various departments, analyze procedures, follow development in relation to previous activity and thus ensure that internal controls are at a good level and will remain so. The assessment has been complemented with a partly expanded verification operation by the company's auditors for certain areas. In relation to this, special followup has been carried out from the central level within the Group. Work aimed at securing good internal control is a constantly ongoing process. During 2009 special efforts were made to improve internal controls at the production company in China and to further increase control over activities in Sweden. The self-assessment project will be expanded to cover the acquired business in France and the US, which at the end of 2009 implemented the SAP business system.

In connection with the formal decision to appoint Martin Lundin to the new position of President and CEO, Mats Persson was selected as new deputy CEO.
External auditors Auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers AB (PwC) has been appointed auditors of the company with Michael Bengtsson and Mats Åkerlund being the lead auditors. The Board's and Group Management's aim is to have a close relationship with the auditors, to the extent that they shall be kept well informed about relevant issues concerning the accounts, reporting procedures and management of the company's/Group's assets. There is therefore a continuous dialogue with the auditors and they participate in at least one Board meeting per year. The auditors receive the minutes of Board meetings, documents relating to Board decisions, and the monthly financial reports for the Group.
