Message from the Chairman

Geoff French Group Chairman

This Corporate Responsibility Report incorporates our Communication on Progress related to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our response as a signatory to the Caring for Climate Change Initiative.

Notwithstanding the muted outcome of the Copenhagen Conference, this is the year in which climate change has become an issue of global concern. Climate change requires a response both in terms of mitigation and adaptation. This provides an opportunity for consultancies like Scott Wilson to redeploy our skills and expertise to address the challenges, design the new infrastructure, adapt existing infrastructure, plan for changing weather patterns and sea levels and help to change entrenched behaviours. We recognise the need to lead by example and so whilst adapting our service offerings we also continue to enhance our own sustainability performance. This Corporate Responsibility Report incorporates our Communication on Progress related to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our response as a signatory to the Caring for Climate Change Initiative. As such it provides an integrated view of our efforts to mainstream environmental and social responsibility in all our activities. The Report covers the period from May 2008 to April 2009. I am pleased to reaffirm our support for the United Nations Global Compact and to report progress during a period of continued change but growing opportunities.

Scott Wilson is a global business, a fact underpinned by the receipt this year of the Queens Award for International Trade. As such we are aware of the global need for sustainable solutions and are committed to complying with international environmental and social performance standards. We apply the same ethical standards and values wherever we work and encourage our clients to emulate best international practice. We welcome comments on this report and suggestions as to how we may improve our performance. To this end, the report is available in both hard copy and on our website.

Introduction
Sustainability runs through the core of Scott Wilson's business

Scott Wilson's aim is to be a sustainable business providing market-leading services for sustainable development. We seek to facilitate development that safeguards the environment, enhances social wellbeing and inclusion and brings economic benefits to our clients and the wider community. One of the ways in which we seek to ensure that our business is sustainable is through our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). We became a signatory to the Compact, the world's largest corporate responsibility initiative, in 2005. The initiative seeks to engage the support of the private sector for a series of universally accepted principles relating to human rights, labour, environmental protection and anticorruption. Scott Wilson seeks to promote these principles in its own operations and to our clients and other stakeholders. We also report annually on our progress. A summary of progress against each of the ten UNGC principles is annexed whilst the report provides a commentary on the principles and our wider efforts to be a sustainable business. The Chairman of Scott Wilson, Geoff French, leads on corporate responsibility. He is assisted and advised by the Sustainability Board and by an Environment Committee.

Key changes include: · clarification that the policies apply to all parts of our worldwide business; · a new policy on conflicts of interest; · a revised policy for supply chain management and procurement giving priority to ensuring that "we always work with suppliers who share our values and approach" and ensuring that all suppliers are approved; and · a new travel policy which requires staff to consider using video or voice conferencing in order to reduce the need to travel. The importance of the corporate policies has been underlined by the organisation of a series of mandatory seminars across all offices.

successful team to develop and cost their plans. The challenge generated significant interest and some seven individuals or teams were selected for interview. The interview team included the Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive and three other members of the Executive Committee. The successful team comprised Mike Bains, Robert Spencer and Mark Willett representing three of the Group's four Sectors and the UK and China businesses. The approach has been highly participatory, with faceto-face meetings with senior staff and sector leaders and questionnaires to all staff. Two questionnaires were circulated, one on climate change and one on social sustainability. They were designed to increase awareness of the issues, encourage creative thinking and determine the need for training and assistance. At the time of writing, the report is in the final stages of completion and will be presented to the Main Board and Executive Committee.

The way we do business

As noted in our 2008/9 report we see our corporate policy statement, The way we do business, as a living document, adapting and responding to change. Accordingly it was revised in 2009/10 to incorporate improved and stronger policies.

The Sustainability Challenge

In order to further embed sustainability within our global business, a competition was launched to develop new ideas. An invitation was extended to all staff and resources made available for the

Environment

Introduction

In this section we set out our approach to corporate environmental responsibility by reference to our internal organisation, external relationships and in relation to our skills, services and projects. In terms of internal organisation, we describe our policies and practices related to the environment, our ISO 14001 certification, carbon footprint and carbon management and procurement policies. For our external relationships, we describe our policies and practice related to the precautionary principle, promoting awareness and environmental technologies.

· to encourage our staff proactively to promote environmental sustainability as a value adding component of our client services; and · to define all environmental issues and develop repeatable measurement processes to ensure ongoing performance reporting and improvement. ISO 14001 Since 2002, we have retained ISO 14001 certification and regard this as key to the way we do business. Our Environmental Management System (EMS), designed to help ensure our operations and project activities are ISO compliant, is continually reviewed to achieve improved outcomes. Carbon Footprint Significant efforts were made during 2009/10 to improve our data collection methods in the UK and, therefore, present our carbon footprint with greater accuracy. We have attained this goal in many areas of data collection. However, there are still some improvements to be made. In order to enable the effective management of energy use and to realise opportunities for savings, remote energy monitoring in the form of SMART meters have now been installed at our UK offices which have the highest energy demand. These five offices account for over 60 per cent of our UK energy consumption and the data provided by the energy manager gives a precise account of how and when we use energy.

Remote energy monitoring has helped identify anomalies in our energy use patterns. To date, these measures alone have saved around 25,000 kg of CO2 and around £20,000 in costs. The success of the scheme means that consideration is being given to its extension to other premises through negotiations with office landlords. We continue to procure Qualifying Combined Heat and Power (QCHP) for all offices within the UK where we have control over the energy contracts. Generation from this source qualifies for exemption due to the highly efficient production of both electricity and heat from a single source. There is a reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 30 per cent compared to conventional generation. We have appointed a new telecommunications company to manage and enhance our video conferencing capabilities. Our new travel policy requires staff to consider using video or voice conferencing in order to reduce the need to travel. As a pilot project, we installed high efficiency hand dryers throughout our Basingstoke office to replace the less efficient older models and paper towels. The hand dryers reduce CO2 emissions by more than a half compared to the combined use of lower efficiency dryers and paper hand towels. The change also significantly reduces our waste generation in the form of paper towels. Given the success of the pilot project, a programme is in place to install high efficiency hand dryers at further Scott Wilson offices during 2010.

Within Scott Wilson

Environment Policy Within Scott Wilson, all of our activities are shaped by an overarching environmental objective to `ensure Scott Wilson goes about its business with a minimal impact on the environment'. To achieve this objective a series of four strategies and targets have been approved by the Main Board. The strategies are: · to embed our commitment to environmental sustainability within our Management Systems and business support processes; · to determine the Carbon Footprint of our operations and deliver a strategy to year on year reduce our reliance on fossil fuels;

A new fleet policy was introduced during 2009 which takes full account of the whole life cost of vehicle operations. A revised selection of vehicles is now available to staff which has been chosen partly on the basis of their environmental credentials. Staff are now actively incentivised to trade down as opposed to trading up. In Bahrain, a staff bus service has been established to assist commuting and reduce the carbon footprint of staff travel. A revised business travel procedure informs staff on the environmental consequences of their travel decisions and encourages the consideration of alternative, more environmentally efficient means of travel. The outcome of all our efforts has been to reduce our carbon footprint in the UK from 9,052 tonnes of CO2 in 2008/2009 to 8,093 tonnes in 2010/11 or by approximately 10 per cent. Some of the reduction relates to the rationalisation of office premises and the closure of some smaller offices. However, the overall reduction in buildings emissions is encouraging. In relation to travel, there were significant reductions in flights and international travel but some increase in local travel leading to an increase overall. A first pilot survey of the carbon footprint of our Hong Kong office has been successfully completed using the appropriate local guidelines. The survey calculated emissions as 600 tonnes of CO2 or about 2.6 tonnes per staff member. The calculations revealed electricity as contributing 78 per cent of emissions, air travel 14 per cent, other travel 6 per cent and waste paper disposal 1.25 per cent. This has provided an incentive to reviewing energy usage and we will be repeating the survey annually. We aim to begin collecting carbon data more widely for our international offices during 2010/11. Waste All our UK offices recycle waste materials produced within the office environment. Scott Wilson is committed to reducing the volume of waste we produce and to reducing the quantities of waste disposed to landfill. We are also working to improve the measurement of the waste we generate. In order to achieve these goals we have implemented a pilot integrated

waste management and recycling solution at our largest UK office in Basingstoke. This has involved the creation of new recycling points on each floor of the building and the removal of all under desk bins in favour of fewer centralised bins for waste which cannot be recycled. The success of this pilot has confirmed the benefits of this approach which will be rolled out to all the main UK offices during 2010/11. In the Middle East, Scott Wilson's Dubai and Bahrain offices are now collecting and recycling paper, plastics and metals. During 2009, Scott Wilson's Roads Sector signed up to WRAP's (Waste & Resources Action Programme) `Halving Waste to Landfill' Commitment. Scott Wilson was one of the first design and engineering consultancies to commit. Driven by the Government's `Strategy for Sustainable Construction', the commitment allows organisations across the construction supply chain to demonstrate their intention to halve waste to landfill by 2012. Over 100 organisations have now signed up, including a number of major contractors. Sustainable Procurement Scott Wilson has a dedicated Group Supply Chain Manager who is responsible for defining the Group's procurement strategies to align with wider company targets. Scott Wilson's strategic approach to supply chain management and procurement is to ensure that the Group: · can be confident that the procurement of goods and services aligns with wider company targets that deliver best value against the overall Group Strategy; · has access to a reliable supply chain of expertise and capability to assist in delivering solutions to clients at competitive prices; · identifies and develops strong, sustainable relationships with key suppliers to assist with the provision of cost effective and efficient operations; and · procures all goods and services in a transparent, sustainable, and ethical manner. Throughout 2009/10, procedures have been developed for cost containment and improved commodity service delivery which will drive continuous improvements in the supply chain.

We encourage our staff to proactively promote environmental sustainability as a volume adding component of our client services.

We continue to work to meet our policy commitments to reduce the amount of resources we use and to promote the use of recycled goods. Negotiations have been ongoing during the year to centralise our UK office goods procurement and waste disposal via a single company which will provide clear data on consumption and waste production. Over 50 per cent of our annual spend with our major stationery and office equipment supplier is on goods which are deemed to be environmentally preferable. Environmental Incidents No environmental incidents were reported during the period.

landfill and to promote reuse and recycling. During the year our efforts helped divert 377,514 metric tonnes of material from landfill and reduced associated carbon emissions by 209,066 metric tonnes. Scott Wilson in Poland has been running an interesting ecological education programme in Warmia-Mazury Province designed to raise awareness of solid waste issues. Seminars and workshops have been organised for local government representatives and teachers and an education programme has been developed for local schools and kindergartens. Special programmes are also to be broadcast on local radio and television. We encourage our clients to consider sustainability in all projects. Our staff includes registered assessors for all the main sustainability assessment tools (BREEAM, LEED and CEEQUAL). We encourage their use as much as possible. Examples of their work are included below. Environmental Technologies Scott Wilson continues to develop new technologies and was awarded the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) East Midlands Merit Award (EMMA) under the Studies & Research category for its study on the use of recycled materials in trench reinstatement. The aim of the project was to make a step change in the efficient use of material arising from excavations associated with renewal and maintenance of utility assets. The objectives were to

External Relationships

Much of our work continues to be associated with designing and planning policies, programmes and projects and assessing their environmental and social impacts. Through tools such as Sustainability Appraisals and Environmental Impact Assessments, we seek to apply the precautionary principle and create better environmental outcomes. Over the year we have advised governments, government agencies, local authorities and private developers as to the environmental impacts of their proposals and have successfully modified their plans to make them more environmentally sensitive. Promoting Awareness We are involved both in developing projects and campaigns with government to promote environmental awareness and in encouraging our clients to enhance their environmental performance. We continue to manage the National Industrial Symbiosis Project (NISP) in London, the south east and east of England. The goal of the project is to reduce the overall amount of waste sent to

a high performing building fabric and operational energy consumption. A Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) system running on waste vegetable oil significantly reduces carbon emissions. Climate Change Strategy for the Infrastructure Advisory Service of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) The Infrastructure Advisory Service of the IFC commissioned us to help develop a climate change strategy. The project involved the development of an indicator to measure performance in terms of climate change and of a series of tools to help integrate climate change issues into the project approval and management process. Capacity building workshops on the strategy helped embed it with IFC officers. Odra River Flood Protection Project, Poland Scott Wilson has been appointed to design and supervise the construction of flood protection measures in and around Wrocklaw. Floods in 1997 took the lives of 54 people and resulted in damages estimated at US$35 million. Over 110,000 people had to be evacuated and 7,000 people were left homeless. The flood protection works, the largest scheme in Europe, will have significant environmental and social benefits and utilises expertise which will be needed widely to help communities adapt to climate change.

Skills, Services, Projects and Awards

Range of Skills/Services Scott Wilson possesses a very wide range of environmental skills which enable us to provide comprehensive advice to clients on all aspects of sustainability. These include air quality, building physics, carbon management, ecology, energy, landscape, noise, planning and sustainable construction. Notable Projects We have selected five projects to demonstrate our active commitment to promoting environmental best practice. Brent Civic Centre We were commissioned to undertake the building design and BREEAM assessment in the design of this iconic building.

Introduction

We took an active role in Sustainabilitylive! We met with stakeholders and highlighted our sustainability services and we ran a conference session on carbon markets.

In this section we set out our approach to corporate social responsibility by reference to our internal organisation, external relationships, and in relation to our skills, services and projects. In terms of internal organisation, we describe our policies and practices related to employment, occupational health, safety and welfare, stakeholders and the activities of the Millennium Project, our staff charity. In terms of our external relationships, we describe our policies and practices related to human rights, discrimination and anti-corruption.

One of our key tools for seeking to be an employer of choice is our Graduate Development Programme. This provides a planned training programme for all new graduates designed to equip them with the skills necessary to be successful consultants. In 2010/11, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances, there were 310 graduates enrolled on the programme. A new Sustainability course has been built into the first year of the Graduate Development Programme to equip staff to meet new challenges. The policy on Dealing with a Concern gives practical guidance on how to act when suspecting malpractice. No cases of malpractice have been identified over the past year. Last year, due to the economic climate, Scott Wilson was forced to implement some redundancies. To make this process as transparent as possible, the Collective Redundancies Consultation Committee was formed, a group of staff nominated to represent Scott Wilson's Regions and Sectors over the three months following redundancy announcements. Over 2009/10, the Committee has met several times to discuss restructuring and has continued to meet even though the statutory requirement has passed. We have also conducted specific consultation in line with other changes such as TUPE transfers, pension scheme changes and local employment issues with staff and their representatives throughout the year.

Within Scott Wilson

Employment Scott Wilson's goal is to `be an employer of choice'. Our relevant policies relate to Internal and External Communications, Dealing with a Concern, Recruitment and Employment, Learning and Development, Reward and Recognition, Use of Drugs and Alcohol. Scott Wilson employs over 5,500 people, across 80 offices throughout Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, India, North America and the UK.

Notwithstanding economic circumstances we have continued to provide placements to students to learn about the day-to-day work of an international consultancy. Occupational Health, Safety And Welfare Our relevant policy relates to Health, Safety and Welfare at Work. We record data on both the number of days lost due to accidents and the accident frequency rate. In 2009/10, the accepted indicator of days lost due to accidents was 1,085 per 100,000 employees and the accident frequency rate 0.055 per 100,000 employees. Compared to the previous year, this represented a decline in the number of days lost due to accidents (from 1,345) and a very marginal increase (0.005) in the accident frequency rate. Stakeholder Engagement Our relevant policies relates to Internal and External Communications and Client Satisfaction.

Our stakeholders include our shareholders, public and private sector clients, sub-consultants, suppliers and the communities in which we work. The key attributes of our approach are good communications, the willingness to listen and learn and the ability to resolve problems and enhance community growth and cohesion. We continue to monitor feedback from clients for all our projects. During 2009/10, Scott Wilson took a conscious decision to attend more public sustainability events in order to meet existing and potential clients and to interact with our stakeholders and discuss sustainability issues. For the first time this year we took an active role in Sustainabilitylive! a major national exhibition and conference in the UK. By sponsoring the main conference and exhibiting at the event, we met with stakeholders and highlighted our sustainability services to a large audience in industry and local/ central government. This included running a conference session on carbon markets and writing articles around the subject in the run up to the event.

We continue to act as a sponsor for RedR, the organisation that provides engineers to support disaster relief. We provide financial support to the organisation and our staff have organised social events to raise funds for the charity.

The Millennium Project

This year, SWMP celebrates its 10th anniversary and to mark this occasion, it has committed to developing four major projects across the globe.

The Scott Wilson Millennium Project (SWMP) is a charity run by Scott Wilson staff and has been involved in funding numerous projects over 2009/10, all of which have been identified by staff. These projects have included connecting a school to a permanent water supply in Tanzania, helping support an orphanage in Cameroon and providing funding for 13 children to be housed at a children's refuge in Gujarat, India. It is now approaching two years since SWMP completed the building of a primary school building in a remote village in Mozambique. Owing to the project's success, we have recently been informed that the school will be extending taught courses to children aged 12­16, for which we hope to provide suitable learning materials. The charity continues to support the school in accordance with our five year commitment and we are currently looking into funding some maintenance work e.g. roof repairs. We also plan to extend the existing library with more books across more subject areas and a wider learning spectrum.

This year, SWMP celebrates its 10th anniversary and to mark this occasion, it has committed to developing four major projects across the globe. The first of these, which was planned during 2009/10, will be a sand dam in Kenya. The dam is a simple piece of engineering which will help provide a regular and clean water supply to a community and its children. The project will also introduce sustainable farming practices including soil management, orchards and a seed bank. Eighteen volunteers from Scott Wilson have been selected to work with the local community to undertake this work in September 2010. Fund raising initiatives organised by staff have focussed on our global fundraising event, Wear a Smile Day. This involved over a dozen different offices raising funds in countries all over the world and featured dress downs, raffles and relay races. In 2010 we raised almost £3,000 through this global event.

External Relationships

Key components include: · a comprehensive training programme; · amendments to the project control process; · amendments to employment polices; · a review of financial policies; · anti-corruption procedures related to third parties; and · annual, independent external audits. We continue to play an active role in the Anti-Corruption Forum and have worked to promote the COST (Construction Industry Transparency Initiative) as professional advisers and as a business.

Human Rights Our relevant policies relate to Working with the Community and in particular to our commitment to respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and to make sure we are not complicit in human rights abuses. Our global workload has continued to expand culminating in the Queen's Award for International Trade. We have not recorded any instances of concern expressed by staff or stakeholders concerning human rights over the course of the year. Discrimination Scott Wilson encourages diversity and recruits, promotes and rewards staff on the basis of merit alone. Anti-Corruption Our relevant policies relate to our Values and Ethics and Share Dealing. In November 2009, the Main Board committed to developing an anti-corruption training and compliance programme to reinforce its high level commitment. A small working party set about preparing the appropriate materials and reported to the Main Board again in April 2010. A detailed implementation programme was agreed.

From this work, we have developed a working definition of social sustainability: `Social sustainability is development (plans or policies) that recognises and supports the need for communities to protect, develop and celebrate their knowledge, culture, governance, services, rights and social structures to ensure resilience, opportunity, social justice and stability for future generations.' Range of Skills and Services Our staff include individuals with professional skills and experience in communications, community engagement and resettlement as well as equalities, health and social impact assessment. Notable Projects We have selected a number of examples of our recent work to demonstrate the range and geographical spread of our professional involvement in projects designed to promote community engagement and empowerment, using a combination of essential communications skills and simple and effective interactive techniques, supported by high quality social research. Larner Road, Bexley Scott Wilson was responsible for carrying out an intensive community consultation and engagement exercise alongside the development of a masterplan for a neighbourhood in east London. Creative visioning and clear and `jargon-free' communication were emphasised throughout the process. Within a tight

Social Sustainability Over the last year Scott Wilson has been taking a fresh look at the social aspects of our projects. We have been investigating how we can best relate to the communities that our projects impact and what skills we need to engage effectively. We sent a questionnaire to all staff inviting comment on our current approach to engaging and working with local communities. Hundreds of staff responded to the survey with 70 per cent indicating they already enjoyed contact with local people and communities and would welcome further training in key `soft' skills such as facilitation, mediation and conducting social surveys. Over half indicated that they have worked on projects that might have benefitted from greater stakeholder involvement.

who now represent a strong residents' organisation for the neighbourhood, leading the community through the ongoing regeneration process. Community Adaptation Planning and Engagement with England's Coastal Communities Research undertaken by Scott Wilson provided the evidence base for Defra to develop a new policy framework and guidance for community adaptation planning and engagement with coastal communities. The research focused on the vulnerability of coastal communities to climate change. It sought to foster resilience in these communities by enabling them to engage with wider strategic planning processes. Our work drew on the views and experiences of coastal communities through a series of case studies. The main output of this project was a guidance note on how to engage communities affected by coastal change. Travel Choices of Children and Young People, Barnsley The Passenger Transport Executive Group (PTEG) commissioned Scott Wilson to conduct a qualitative analysis of the issues likely to affect the travel choices of children and young people for both journeys to school and off-peak leisure trips using public transport. In addition to providing qualitative evidence on a range of issues affecting children's travel choices (including journey cost, the bus `experience', service availability, inconvenience, vehicle/personal safety and lifestyle considerations from the existing bus routes), the research was designed to identify the attitudinal barriers to public transport use. Conclusions were

based on the significance of the findings of the research to children's decision-making. Recommendations for improving public transport service and the price sensitivities were influential in developing a new concessionary fares policy. National Noise Action Week/International Noise Awareness Day This year, Scott Wilson took part in National Noise Action Week (26 ­ 30 April 2010) and International Noise Awareness Day (28 April 2010), by undertaking a series of surveys in two parks in London. These surveys were designed to raise awareness of the effects of noise in urban environments and to gather people's views on noise impacts. In 2008, working with the City of Westminster in London, Scott Wilson developed a `tranquillity toolkit', a methodology that quantifies users' subjective views on their sense of tranquillity in urban open spaces. In developing the toolkit, we found that while noise is the most important determinant in reducing people's feeling of tranquillity, reducing noise can enhance tranquillity in only a limited way. Other factors including a sense of safety, a visually pleasing landscape and the culture of a place also contribute to the sense of tranquillity. Poverty Reduction in Mozambique Scott Wilson has been working with the Millennium Challenge Corporation as part of their comprehensive programme to reduce poverty in the northern part of the country. During 2009/10 we were working on the upgrading of the Namiolo to Metoro Road to improve access to markets and services.

project programme, key deliverables included creating an engagement strategy, carrying out a stakeholder audit, two large public events, setting up and building the capacity of a 15 member residents working group and facilitating working group meetings and workshops. Throughout the process, the Scott Wilson team acted as the conduit between the residents and the main project team, feeding residents' views and priorities back into the masterplanning process. The residents' working group meetings facilitated by Scott Wilson served as a semi-formal training and empowerment programme for a core group of residents,
