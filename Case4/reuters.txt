NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meet the new Goldman Sachs, trying to be the same
as the old Goldman Sachs.

The fifth-largest U.S. bank said late Monday that it earned $1.66
billion in the first quarter, as it boosted its risk and assets.




It also raised extra capital to repay the government, in a move widely
seen as an effort to avoid extra regulatory scrutiny, particularly
when it comes to compensation.

These are unusual steps in an environment where most Wall Street banks
are slimming down their balance sheets, taking risk only reluctantly
and slashing compensation.




"Goldman wants to go back to the way things were before the crisis,
where they do what they do best, which is taking risk, and the
government leaves them alone," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst
covering financial stocks at Optique Capital Management in Milwaukee.

It may seem like a surprising tack for Goldman, just weeks after the
bank's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, admitted that the financial
services industry has made many mistakes.

He said in a Washington speech that decisions made at many banks
during the crisis, particularly regarding pay, "look self-serving and
greedy in hindsight."
