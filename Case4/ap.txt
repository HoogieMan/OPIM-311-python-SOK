WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is drawing up plans to
disclose the conditions of the 19 biggest banks in the country,
according to senior administration officials, as it tries to restore
confidence in the financial system without unnerving investors.

The administration has decided to reveal some sensitive details of the
stress tests now being completed after concluding that keeping many of
the findings secret could send investors fleeing from financial
institutions rumored to be weakest.

While all of the banks are expected to pass the tests, some are
expected to be graded more highly than others. Officials have
deliberately left murky just how much they intend to reveal — or to
encourage the banks to reveal — about how well they would weather
difficult economic conditions over the next two years.

As a result, indicating which banks are most vulnerable still runs
some risk of doing what officials hope to avoid.

The decision on handling the stress tests underscores the delicate
balancing act by the government, which has spent hundreds of billions
to stabilize banks. Despite some signs of improvement in the financial
system, many economists remain concerned that banks are still weighed
down with toxic assets stemming from the housing downturn.

Until now, the Treasury Department has simply said that it will reveal
the amounts of any new infusions of capital into banks that regulators
judge to be at risk if the economic downturn is prolonged or the
economy takes a further dive.
